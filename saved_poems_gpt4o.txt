"In shadows deep where whispered fears abide,  
The moon, a ghostly witness to the night,  
Doth cast her pallor on the graveyard wide,  
Where restless souls take flight in spectral light.

"In the hush of twilight,  
where whispers of lavender drift,  
your laughter dances like fireflies,  
painting constellations on the canvas of dusk.  

I trace the silhouette of your dreams,  
each curve a secret,  
each sigh a promise,  
woven in the tapestry of starlit breaths.  

Time unfurls like a petal,  
each moment a fragrance,  
and I find myself lost,  
in the labyrinth of your gaze,  
where echoes of eternity linger.  

The moon spills silver upon our shadows,  
a gentle witness to the language of our silence,  
as our hearts pulse in sync,  
a symphony composed of unspoken words,  
the space between us, sacred and infinite.
