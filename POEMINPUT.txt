In the hush of twilight,  
where whispers of lavender drift,  
your laughter dances like fireflies,  
painting constellations on the canvas of dusk.  

I trace the silhouette of your dreams,  
each curve a secret,  
each sigh a promise,  
woven in the tapestry of starlit breaths.  

Time unfurls like a petal,  
each moment a fragrance,  
and I find myself lost,  
in the labyrinth of your gaze,  
where echoes of eternity linger.  

The moon spills silver upon our shadows,  
a gentle witness to the language of our silence,  
as our hearts pulse in sync,  
a symphony composed of unspoken words,  
the space between us, sacred and infinite.
