{"text": "When Icicles hang by the wall so high,\nAnd frosty breath doth paint the window pane,\nMy love doth warm me with her gentle eye,\nAnd chaseth winter's cold from heart and brain.\nHer laughter rings, a bell of purest sound,\nThat wakes the slumbering birds in leafy trees,\nAnd melts the snow that gathers on the ground,\nAnd stirs the gentle breeze to summer ease.\nHer touch, a feather light upon my skin,\nDoth banish shadows and ignite the soul,\nAnd all the world, once bleak and cold within,\nIs filled with warmth, beyond my own control.\n   So let the winter winds howl fierce and strong,\n   My love's a summer's day, where I belong."}
{"text": "When icicles hang heavy on the eaves,\nAnd frosted breath doth paint the window pane,\nMy heart, it doth with winter's chill believe\nThat love's sweet fire is quenched by wind and rain.\nYet in the hearth, a warming ember glows,\nA tiny spark that whispers of the spring,\nOf verdant fields where gentle zephyr blows,\nAnd birdsong fills the air, a joyful thing.\nThough winter's grip doth hold the world in thrall,\nAnd shadows lengthen with the fading light,\nMy hope remains, beyond the frozen wall,\nThat love's bright flame will burn both strong and bright.\n   So let the snow fall soft upon the ground,\n   For in my heart, true love will still be found."}
{"text": "When Love's sweet song doth fill the air with glee,\nAnd gentle breezes whisper through the trees,\nMy heart doth leap with joyous ecstasy,\nAnd finds in nature solace and sweet ease.\nBut when the storm doth rage and shadows fall,\nAnd chilling winds do pierce me to the bone,\nMy spirit faints, and fears begin to thrall,\nAnd I am left to wander all alone.\nYet even in the darkest, dreariest night,\nA flicker of hope remains within my breast,\nA tiny star that sheds its gentle light,\nAnd whispers softly, \"Love shall bring you rest.\"\nSo let the tempest rage, the shadows loom,\nFor Love's enduring flame shall conquer gloom."}
{"text": "When I do gaze upon thy lovely face,\nMy heart doth leap with joy, a joyful sound,\nAnd all my woes do vanish without trace,\nAs if by magic, I am heaven-bound.\nThine eyes, like stars that twinkle in the night,\nDo pierce my soul and steal away my breath,\nAnd in their depths, a wondrous, pure delight,\nDoth banish shadows, conquering even death.\nThy lips, like roses, soft and red and sweet,\nDo promise pleasures that my soul desires,\nAnd when our hands in gentle union meet,\nA fire of passion in my heart transpires.\n   So let us love, while yet we have the grace,\n   And in each other, find our happy place."}
{"text": "When icicles hang heavy on the eaves,\nAnd biting winds do whistle through the trees,\nMy heart doth yearn for summer's gentle leaves,\nAnd sunbeams dancing on the gentle breeze.\nThe world is draped in white, a frozen scene,\nWhere frosted breath hangs like a misty veil,\nAnd shadows stretch, both somber and serene,\nAs nature sleeps, beneath the winter's gale.\nBut even in this cold and dreary plight,\nA hope remains, a flicker in the dark,\nThat spring will come, with all its vibrant light,\nAnd melt the ice, leaving its chilling mark.\n    So let the snow fall soft upon the ground,\n    For spring's return, a promise shall be found."}
{"text": "When love's sweet song doth fill the air with grace,\nAnd gentle breezes whisper through the trees,\nMy heart doth leap, a smile upon my face,\nFor in thy eyes, my soul finds perfect ease.\nThy beauty shines, a beacon in the night,\nA guiding star that leads my steps along,\nAnd banishes all shadows from my sight,\nAnd makes my spirit joyful and so strong.\nNo earthly treasure can compare with thee,\nNor any jewel that the earth may hold,\nFor thou art more than wealth could ever be,\nA priceless gem, more precious than pure gold.\n   So let us walk hand-in-hand through life's brief span,\n   And cherish every moment that we can."}
