{"text": "The Summer Bower It is a place whither Ive often goneFor peace, and found it, secret, hushed, and cool, A beautiful recess in neighboring woods. Trees of the soberest hues, thick-leaved and tall, Arch it oerhead and column it around, Framing a covert, natural and wild,Domelike and dim; though nowhere so enclosed But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot Unwearied and unweakened. Sound is here A transient and unfrequent visitor;Yet if the day be calm, not often then, Whilst the high pines in one anothers arms Sleep, you may sometimes with unstartled ear Catch the far fall of voices, how remote You know not, and you do not care to know. The turf is soft and green, but not a flower Lights the recess, save one, star-shaped and brightI do not know its namewhich here and there Gleams like a sapphire set in emerald.A narrow opening in the branched roof,A single one, is large enough to show,With that half-glimpse a dreamer loves so much, The blue air and the blessing of the sky.Thither I always bent my idle steps,When griefs depressed, or joys disturbed my heart, And found the calm I looked for, or returned Strong with the quite rapture in my soul. But one day,One of those July days when winds have fled One knows not whither, I, most sick in mind With thoughts that shall be nameless, yet, no doubt, Wrong, or at least unhealthful, since though dark With gloom, and touched with discontent, they had No adequate excuse, nor cause, nor end,I, with these thoughts, and on this summer day, Entered the accustomed haunt, and found for once No medicinal virtue. Not a leafStirred with the whispering welcome which I sought, But in a close and humid atmosphere,Every fair plant and implicated boughHung lax and lifeless. Something in the place, Its utter stillness, the unusual heat,And some more secret influence, I thought, Weighed on the sense like sin. Above I saw, Though not a cloud was visible in heaven,The palid sky look through a glazed mistLike a blue eye in death. The change, perhaps, Was natural enough; my jaundiced sight,The weather, and the time explain it all:Yet have I drawn a lesson from the spot,And shrined it in these verses for my heart. Thenceforth those tranquil precincts I have sought Not less, and in all shades of various moods; But always shun to desecrate the spotBy weak repinings, sickly sentiments,Or inconclusive sorrows. Nature, thoughPure as she was in Eden when her breathKissed the white brow of Eve, doth not refuse,In her own way and with a just reserve, To sympathize with human suffering; But for the pains, the fever, and the fret Engendered of a weak, unquiet heart,She hath no solace; and who seeks her when These be the troubles over which he moans, Reads in her unreplying lineaments Rebukes, that, to the guilty consciousness, Strike like contempt.", "label": "human"}

And while no one would hire Monty Cliftafter his facially disfiguring car-wreck,Brando convinced the studio that the other, slightlyolder, kid from Omaha was the right man.No one could play a more sensitive-tough than Monty,like the artist-bugler-boxer Prewittmistaken for the enemy, gunned downby his own men in the Pearl Harbor dawn;or the way, as the seraphic cowboy Matt Dunson,he got a rise out of his demented empire builderfather, John Wayne, by kicking over a tin cup,sloshing the coffee into the dust to show his disgust.Clift knew that Lions director Edward Dmytrykwas searching for someone to play a keysupporting roleas Frank Sinatra had in From Here ToEternityyet he was stunned to hear it wasJerry Lewiss partner in shlock.Clift softened, nauseated when he sawMartins competitionpander to the crowd on Broadway.Lucky for Monty that he let it go: the two mennot only became friends; it was Deanwho put the man with the wired-jaw to bedwhen he had the chloral hydrate and alcohol wobblies.Ignorant of Brandos intervention on his behalf,Monty told Dean that Marlons fifty takes per scenewere getting on his nerves more and moreand he vowed to walk off the set if he triedONE MORE TIME to have his German soldier diewith arms spread wide to echo the crucifixion.Clift, wasted with self-recrimination at forty-five.Martin, an actor for whom one run through a scenealmost always sufficed.Dean got a chuckle out of Monty with his response.It should be awful good with so many takes.Then the future flashed before him.I guess there are directors who want us to dothe same scene over and over again too.Sure, lots. Some of the best.I guess I got spoiled. Jerry and I gotto where we pretty much called the shots.And thenwithout any foreknowledgethat hed be doing his only two otherserious roles in the next two yearsand be subject to directorial rule on the sets ofSome Came Running and Rio Bravohe vowed in the future to set up his golf netbefore shooting started on a picture.Dean appeared to float, perfectionnever an aspiration: that he was already as well knownfor his insouciance and drunk persona as forhis singing and acting doesnt mean he was so well-defendedthat he didnt feel any pressure about workingwith such aces as Brando and Clift.He didnt have to stretch to play a would-be draft dodger,Michael Whiteacre: a likeable coward like myself,a screenwriter in Shaws novel, a singer in the movie.The army doctor feeds Dean his first line in Lionsas if his future were visible in the instant:art and life exquisitely commingled.Doctor: For a man your age and in your professionyoure in excellent health. How do you manage it?Martin doesnt hesitate: Clean liquor.But sauntering through this role didnt meaneverything was swell: he felt so out-of-placeon location in France he gave up the offer ofa choice part in The Guns of Navaronebecause it meant going back to Europe.In his middle years, he ambled through the roleof Matt Helm in another tonelessBondian takeoff, and when Columbiawanted to shoot Murderers Rowon location in Cannes, Dinoset the studio straight: fuck no,just build some fake Riviera sets. 2A diffident crooner, he needed a stooge.License to fuck around on stage.After his split with Jerry, Dinos drunk persona grewinto a ghostly partner, and by the time he had his own TV showthe public was so saturated with his presence,many conflated the persona and the person.When he landed the drunks key role in Rio Bravo,he turned to Brando for help, what should I do?Brando told him what to think about.The more inscrutable the subjectthe more this spectre stands out in relief.Part of Martins appeal was that no one knew him.It wasnt a mask; his detachment was who he was.He showed up, his spirit remained elsewhere.His wives and children found him unknowable.It wasnt personal. When the Martins entertained,the guests carried on while Dino disappearedinto his room to watch westerns on TV, alone.It wasnt personal. When the producer ofThe Colgate Comedy Hour suggested they have lunchto get to know one another, Dinoset him straight: No one gets to know me.Martin was a man no one came close to knowing.What does it mean, to know someone? 3Why ask such questions at all after Socratesbeguiled us out of answers and set us onthe inexhaustible path...dialectics?Dont you think I havent wondered if I haventstrayed from my true path as I find myselftracking the trajectory of such non-exemplary lives?Youre thinking its a trick, and will not answer,but before you judge my dissolute subjectwho like the money but thought all the attentionwas a joke because a singer is nothingas a derelict choice, consider how philosophy,while striving to become more concretecontinues to recoil before the problem of other minds.And it is said that Monsieur Sartre turned palerthan his martini, when Raymond Aronchallenged the Husserlians, at the Bec de Gazin Montparnasse, to make philosophyout of a cocktail glass. 4Theres something about everyone no one can know.There was no question of Dino taking ordersand being bossed around was out of bounds:penalty shot incurred for the perpetrator,who was, this time, the imperious Billy Wilderwhose streak of hits was breaking fast.Dino as always was doing his job,which was to literally play himself in Kiss Me,Stupid", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Famous Tay Whale Twas in the month of December, and in the year 1883,That a monster whale came to Dundee,Resolved for a few days to sport and play,And devour the small fishes in the silvery Tay.So the monster whale did sport and playAmong the innocent little fishes in the beautiful Tay,Until he was seen by some men one day,And they resolved to catch him without delay.When it came to be known a whale was seen in the Tay,Some men began to talk and to say,We must try and catch this monster of a whale,So come on, brave boys, and never say fail.Then the people together in crowds did run,Resolved to capture the whale and to have some fun!So small boats were launched on the silvery Tay,While the monster of the deep did sport and play.Oh! it was a most fearful and beautiful sight,To see it lashing the water with its tail all its might,And making the water ascend like a shower of hail,With one lash of its ugly and mighty tail.Then the water did descend on the men in the boats,Which wet their trousers and also their coats;But it only made them the more determined to catch the whale,But the whale shook at them his tail.Then the whale began to puff and to blow,While the men and the boats after him did go,Armed well with harpoons for the fray,Which they fired at him without dismay.And they laughed and grinned just like wild baboons,While they fired at him their sharp harpoons:But when struck with the harpoons he dived below,Which filled his pursuers hearts with woe:Because they guessed they had lost a prize,Which caused the tears to well up in their eyes;And in that their anticipations were only right,Because he sped on to Stonehaven with all his might:And was first seen by the crew of a Gourdon fishing boat,Which they thought was a big coble upturned afloat;But when they drew near they saw it was a whale,So they resolved to tow it ashore without fail.So they got a rope from each boat tied round his tail,And landed their burden at Stonehaven without fail;And when the people saw it their voices they did raise,Declaring that the brave fishermen deserved great praise.And my opinion is that God sent the whale in time of need,No matter what other people may think or what is their creed;I know fishermen in general are often very poor,And God in His goodness sent it to drive poverty from their door.So Mr John Wood has bought it for two hundred and twenty-six pound,And has brought it to Dundee all safe and all sound;Which measures 40 feet in length from the snout to the tail,So I advise the people far and near to see it without fail.Then hurrah! for the mighty monster whale,Which has got 17 feet 4 inches from tip to tip of a tail!Which can be seen for a sixpence or a shilling,That is to say, if the people all are willing.", "label": "human"}

Arriving in our fourth-floor room, we found a bed, a scarred bureau, and a bathroom door with a cut on one side the exact shape of the toilet bowl that was in its way when I closed it. I opened and shut the door, admiring the fit and despairing of it. You discovered the initials of lovers carved on the bureaus top in a zigzag, breaking heart. How wrong the place was to us then, unable to see the portents of our future that seem so clear now in the naivete of the arrangements we made, the hotels disdain for those with little money, the carving of pain and love.

{"text": "the children of immigrants When I am a toddler, a child, a tween, a teen, and a young adult, I am called an ancestral soul, a ti gran moun, a little old person. Adults study me and decide that I am wise beyond my years, mature for my age, emotionally ripe. I am told it is unusual to meet a five-ten-fifteen-year-old girl who does not slouch or mumble or speak in monosyllables. When I do the things that come naturally to mewhen I hold my spine up erect, when I wait my turn to speak, when I speak having listened, carefully, when I enunciate, when I look grown-ups in the eyeI am told I must have been here before. \"How do you know?\" one college professor asks me after she has seen a psychologically violent play I have written at age nineteen. \"How do you already know? In high school, I charm my teachers. They encourage me to write speeches about feminism that I recite for International Women's Day at City Hall or deliver as part of conference panels at local universities. If you were older,\" they tell me, \"we would probably be friends. One of them even flirts with me. Among my peers I exist somewhere between amicably mysterious and irrevocably dorky. The popular kids greet me in the hallways, but they never invite me to their beer-drenched parties. I will never play Spin the Bottle. I will never play Seven Minutes in Heaven. My mother tells me she is protecting me from boys, but the truth is, after I do my homework, she wants me to type up another family friends resume or resignation letter. At home, I am a bridge, a cultural interpreter, a spokesperson, a trusted ally, an American who is Haitian too, but also definitely American. The children of immigrants don't get to be children. We lose our innocence watching our parents' backs bend, break. I am an old soul because when I am young, I watch my parents' spirits get slaughtered. In Haiti, they were middle class. Hopeful teachers. Home owners. They were black like their live-in servants. They donated clothes to the poor. They gave up everything they knew to inherit American dreams. And here, they join factory lines, wipe shit from mean old white men's behinds, scrub five-star hotel toilets for dimes above minimum wage. Here, they shuck and jive and step and fetch and play chauffeur to people who aren't as smart as they are, people who do not speak as many languages as they do. In the 1980s, they are barred from giving blood because newscasters and politicians say that AIDS comes from where they come from: Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, a black magic island that spawns boat people and chaos, a place of illiterate zombies, orphan beggars and brazen political corruption. When I am a child, my childhood is a luxury my family cannot afford. Their dignity is not spared, so my innocence is not spared. They are humiliated and traumatized daily, so I become a nurse to their trauma. I am told too much, so I know too much, so I am wise beyond my years. When I am six, my mother tells me that when she found out she was pregnant with me at age nineteen, she tried to kill the baby.\" She says \"the baby,\" as if it isnt me shes talking about; as if I am not the expensive, scandalous daughter who forced my way into her world despite the abortion-inducing herbal teas she drank and her frantic leaps off of small buildings. When I am sixteen, my father calls me on the phone to, inevitably, weep. He says, \"Living in this country, I have learned not to hope for things. Only you are my hope. Only you.\"Soyes, I grow up fast.", "label": "human"}

Why should of all things man unruld Such unproportiond dwellings build? The beasts are by their dens exprest, And birds contrive an equal nest; The low roofd tortoises do dwell In cases fit of tortoise-shell; No creature loves an empty space; Their bodies measure out their place. But he, superfluously spread, Demands more room alive than dead; And in his hollow palace goes Where winds as he themselves may lose. What need of all this marble crust Timpark the wanton mote of dust, That thinks by breadth the world tunite Though the first builders faild in height? But all things are composed here Like nature, orderly and near; In which we the dimensions find Of that more sober age and mind, When larger sized men did stoop To enter at a narrow loop; As practising, in doors so straight, To strain themselves through Heavens gate. And surely when the after age Shall hither come in pilgrimage, These sacred places to adore, By Vere and Fairfax trod before, Men will dispute how their extent Within such dwarfish confines went; And some will smile at this, as well As Romulus his bee-like cell. Humility alone designs Those short but admirable lines, By which, ungirt and unconstraind, Things greater are in less containd. Let others vainly strive timmure The circle in the quadrature! These holy mathematics can In evry figure equal man. Yet thus the laden house does sweat, And scarce endures the master great, But where he comes the swelling hall Stirs, and the square grows spherical; More by his magnitude distressd, Then he is by its straightness pressd, And too officiously it slights That in itself which him delights. So honour better lowness bears, Than that unwonted greatness wears; Height with a certain grace does bend, But low things clownishly ascend. And yet what needs there here excuse, Where evry thing does answer use? Where neatness nothing can condemn, Nor pride invent what to contemn? A stately frontispiece of poor Adorns without the open door; Nor less the rooms within commends Daily new furniture of friends. The house was built upon the place Only as for a mark of grace; And for an inn to entertain Its lord a while, but not remain. Him Bishops-Hill, or Denton may, Or Billbrough, better hold than they; But nature here hath been so free As if she said leave this to me.

{"text": "Autumn Shade 1The autumn shade is thin. Grey leaves lie faintWhere they will lie, and, where the thick green was,Light stands up, like a presence, to the sky.The trees seem merely shadows of its age.From off the hill, I hear the logging crew,The furious and indifferent saw, the slowResponse of heavy pine; and I recallThat goddesses have died when their trees died.Often in summer, drinking from the spring,I sensed in its cool breath and in its voiceA living form, darker than any shadeAnd without feature, passionate, yet chillWith lust to fix in ice the buoyant rimAncient of days, the mother of us all.Now, toward his destined passion there, the strong,Vivid young man, reluctant, may returnFrom suffering in his own experienceTo lie down in the darkness. In this time,I stay in doors. I do my work. I sleep.Each morning, when I wake, I assent to wake.The shadow of my fist moves on this page,Though, even now, in the wood, beneath a bank,Coiled in the leaves and cooling rocks, the snakeDoes as it must, and sinks into the cold.2Nights grow colder. The Hunter and the BearFollow their tranquil course outside my window.I feel the gentian waiting in the wood,Blossoms waxy and blue, and blue-green stemsOf the amaryllis waiting in the garden.I know, as though I waited what they wait,The cold that fastens ice about the root,A heavenly form, the same in all its changes,Inimitable, terrible, and still,And beautiful as frost. Fire warms my room.Its light declares my books and pictures. Gently,A dead soprano sings Mozart and Bach.I drink bourbon, then go to bed, and sleepIn the Promethean heat of summers essence.3Awakened by some fear, I watch the sky.Compelled as though by purposes they know,The stars, in their blue distance, still affirmThe bond of heaven and earth, the ancient way.This old assurance haunts small creatures, dazedIn icy mud, though cold may freeze them thereAnd leave them as they are all summer long.I cannot sleep. Passion and consequence,The brutal given, and all I have desiredEvade me, and the lucid majestyThat warmed the dull barbarian to life.So I lie here, left with self-consciousness,Enemy whom I love but whom his changeAnd his forgetfulness again compel,Impassioned, toward my lost indifference,Faithful, but to an absence. Who shares my bed?Who lies beside me, certain of his waking,Led sleeping, by his own dream, to the day?4If I ask you, angel, will you come and leadThis ache to speech, or carry me, like a child,To riot? Ever young, you come of ageRemote, a pledge of distances, this pangI notice at dusk, watching you subsideFrom tree-tops and from fields. Mysterious self,Image of the fabulous alien,Even in sleep you summon me, even there,When, under his native tree, Odysseus hearsHis own incredible past and future, whisperedBy wisdom, but by wisdom in disguise.5Thinking of a bravura deed, a placeSacred to a divinity, an oldVerse that seems new, I postulate a manMastered by his own image of himself.Who is it says, I am? Sensuous angel,Vessel of nerve and blood, the impoverished heirOf an awareness other than his own?Not these, but one to come? For there he is,In a steel helmet, raging, fearing his death,Carrying bread and water to a quiet,Placing ten sounds together in one sound:Confirming his election, or merely still,Sleeping, or in a colloquy with the sun.6Snow and then rain. The roads are wet. A carSlips and strains in the mire, and I rememberDriving in France: weapons-carriers and jeeps;Our clothes and bodies stiffened by mud; our mindsDiverted from fear. We labor. Overhead,A plane, Berlin or Frankfurt, now New York.The car pulls clear. My neighbor smiles. He is old.Was this our wisdom, simply, in a chance,In danger, to be mastered by a task,Like groping round a chair, through a door, to bed?7A dormant season, and, under the dripping tree,Not sovereign, ordering nothing, letting the pastDo with me as it will, I savor placeAnd weather, air and sun. Though HerculesConfronts his nature in his deed, repeatsHis purposes, and is his will, intact,Magnificent, and memorable, I tryThe simplest forms of our old poverty.I seek no end appointed in my absenceBeyond the silence I already share.8I drive home with the books that I will read.The streets are harsh with traffic. Where I oncePlayed as a boy amid old stands of pine,Row after row of houses. Lined by the newDebris of wealth and power, the broken road.Then miles of red clay bank and frugal ground.At last, in the minor hills, my fathers place,Where I can find my way as in a thoughtGardens, the trees we planted, all we share.A Cherokee trail runs north to summer hunting.I see it, when I look up from the page.9In nameless warmth, sun light in every corner,Bending my body over my glowing book,I share the room. Is it with a voice or touchOr look, as of an absence, learned by love,Now, merely mine? Annunciation, specterOf the worn out, lost, or broken, telling what future.What vivid loss to come, you change the roomAnd him who reads here. Restless, he will stir,Look round, and see the room renewed and line,Color, and shape as, in desire, they are,Not shadows but substantial light, explicit,Bright as glass, inexhaustible, and true.1OMy shadow moves, until, at noon, I standWithin its seal, as in the finished past.But in the place where effect and cause are joined,In the warmth or cold of my remembering,Of love, of partial freedom, the time to beTrembles and glitters again in windy light.For nothing is disposed. The slow soft windTilting the blood-root keeps its gentle edge.The intimate cry, both sinister and tender,Once heard, is heard confined in its reserve.My image of myself, apart, informedBy many deaths, resists me, and I stayAlmost as I have been, intact, aware,Alive, though proud and cautious, even afraid.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A Sequence of Sonnets on the Death of Robert Browning I The clearest eyes in all the world they read With sense more keen and spirit of sight more true Than burns and thrills in sunrise, when the dew Flames, and absorbs the glory round it shed, As they the light of ages quick and dead, Closed now, forsake us: yet the shaft that slew Can slay not one of all the works we knew, Nor death discrown that many-laurelled head. The works of words whose life seems lightning wrought, And moulded of unconquerable thought, And quickened with imperishable flame, Stand fast and shine and smile, assured that nought May fade of all their myriad-moulded fame, Nor England's memory clasp not Browning's name. II Death, what hast thou to do with one for whom Time is not lord, but servant? What least part Of all the fire that fed his living heart, Of all the light more keen that sundawn's bloom That lit and led his spirit, strong as doom And bright as hope, can aught thy breath may dart Quench? Nay, thou knowest he knew thee what thou art, A shadow born of terror's barren womb, That brings not forth save shadows. What art thou, To dream, albeit thou breathe upon his brow, That power on him is given thee,that thy breath Can make him less than love acclaims him now, And hears all time sound back the word it saith? What part hast thou then in his glory, Death? III A graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve: Venice and winter, hand in deadly hand, Have slain the lover of her sunbright strand And singer of a stormbright Christmas Eve. A graceless guerdon we that loved receive For all our love, from that the dearest land Love worshipped ever. Blithe and soft and bland, Too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave, Shone on our dreams and memories evermore The domes, the towers, the mountains and the shore That gird or guard thee, Venice: cold and black Seems now the face we loved as he of yore. We have given thee loveno stint, no stay, no lack: What gift, what gift is this thou hast given us back? IV But heto him, who knows what gift is thine, Death? Hardly may we think or hope, when we Pass likewise thither where to-night is he, Beyond the irremeable outer seas that shine And darken round such dreams as half divine Some sunlit harbour in that starless sea Where gleams no ship to windward or to lee, To read with him the secret of thy shrine. There too, as here, may song, delight, and love, The nightingale, the sea-bird, and the dove, Fulfil with joy the splendour of the sky Till all beneath wax bright as all above: But none of all that search the heavens, and try The sun, may match the sovereign eagle's eye. V Among the wondrous ways of men and time He went as one that ever found and sought And bore in hand the lamp-like spirit of thought To illume with instance of its fire sublime The dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime. No spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought, No faith, no fear, no dream, no rapture, nought That blooms in wisdom, nought that burns in crime, No virtue girt and armed and helmed with light, No love more lovely than the snows are white, No serpent sleeping in some dead soul's tomb, No song-bird singing from some live soul's height, But he might hear, interpret, or illume With sense invasive as the dawn of doom. VI What secret thing of splendour or of shade Surmised in all those wandering ways wherein Man, led of love and life and death and sin, Strays, climbs, or cowers, allured, absorbed, afraid, Might not the strong and sunlike sense invade Of that full soul that had for aim to win Light, silent over time's dark toil and din, Life, at whose touch death fades as dead things fade? O spirit of man, what mystery moves in thee That he might know not of in spirit, and see The heart within the heart that seems to strive, The life within the life that seems to be, And hear, through all thy storms that whirl and drive, The living sound of all men's souls alive? VII He held no dream worth waking: so he said, He who stands now on death's triumphal steep, Awakened out of life wherein we sleep And dream of what he knows and sees, being dead. But never death for him was dark or dread: \"Look forth\" he bade the soul, and fear not. Weep, All ye that trust not in his truth, and keep Vain memory's vision of a vanished head As all that lives of all that once was he Save that which lightens from his word: but we, Who, seeing the sunset-coloured waters roll, Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea, Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole, And life and death but shadows of the soul.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Heredities (1) Etymology When she was seven, my grandmother suffered from fever and swollen glands. The doctors believed her tonsils were inflamed, that she needed surgery. Instead, she went to a curandera. The curandera divined that a jealous relative had cast a curse on her and, now, her language of kindness was bound to her throat, the unspoken swelling her glands.As a child my grandmother spoke to santitos with a voice like a chestnut: ruddy and warm, seeds dropping from her mouth. The santitos would take her words into themselves, her voice growing within them like grapevines.During the tonsillitis, when the words no longer fell like seeds from her lips, the santito's vineyards of accent and voice grew vapid, dry as a parched mouth. They went to her tongue and asked why silence imprisoned the words of the child, why lumps were present under her chin, why tears drew channels down her cheeks.I asked my grandmother how her tongue replied. After touching my cheek, she told me she had a dream that night: She was within her lungs and she rose like breath through the moist of her throat. She remembered her tonsils swinging before her like fleshy apples, then a hand taking them into a fist, harvesting their sound. She told me her throat opened in two spots like insect eyes and the names of her children came flying through her wounds like peacocks.Patting my thigh, she said, \"That is why the name of your mother is Maria, because she is a prayer, a song of praise to the Holy Mother.\" She told me this, then showed me two scars on her throattiny scars, like two eyelids stitched closed.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "What We Know of Death by Drowning 1. Josef Mengele Drowns While Swimming at a Beach in Brazil, 1979 His name then: Wolfgang Gerhard.How easy, slipping on another mans skin. Another country, too, its suns heat and lightas insistent as a pairof forceps. His pants, left crumpledon the beach, forged papersand a few hard candies in the pocket. Where the water was shallow, he could look down and see his shadow passing overthe pale sand, a wobbly twin, matching himstroke for stroke for stroke. 2. Li Po Drowns Trying to Embrace the Reflection of the Moon in the Yangtze, 762 The moon is no drinker of wine, so I mustcompensate. Surely youve heard the crows and nightingalesegging me on? The day has dispersedfrom the courtyards like a gang of sparrows, and nothing is left of the world that is notpecked-over, hard and dark as the dream of an apple seed. The young men laughat an old man drinkingalone, but here are my companions: my shadow, as loyal and thin as a starved dog, and the moon, his whole face wrinkling with laughter. 3. Bob, the Circus Seal, Drowns Himself in His Tank in Galveston, 1911 By then his teeth had rotted out, and he often turned to his ownerwith his mouth open as if about to speak, a ruined smelljetting from inside. He had already attempted it, three days before,but his owner dove in and pulled him uponto the slimy planks. His circus show days were long gone. Sure, some afternoonsa kid might walk by and see the scabby painting on the side of the building: the hoop,the pedestal, the ghostof a man in a top hat, the striped ball now like a clotof pus streakedwith blood, hovering over the sleek, dark head. 4. Natalie Wood Drowns under Mysterious Circumstances near Santa Catalina Island, 1981 Let me tell you: death is a long silk glovedropped to the floor. It doesnt remember the heftof the arm, the fingers dancing. That limb is gone, and nothingwill hold its shape again. You twirl your pastel skirt. You watchtwo carsrace toward the cliff, and there is nothing you can do. So many lives youve enteredlike a room: swooned, held the prop pistolto your own face, sangfor the back row. But was it your voice? What was that nameyou were born into? Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko?What happened to her? Was she the onetaken, her family butchered, livinganother lifeamong the enemy people? Was it the morning?when she stopped scanningthe horizon for rescuers that she turned into you? 5. Hippasus of Metapontum Is Drowned at Sea for the Heresy of Discovering Irrational Numbers, ca. 500 BCE His fellow Pythagoreans had already builta shrine to his memory and placed it where he passed by every day, but he did not take the hint. It was on the shipthat they seized him. God was an integer, firmas an unripe apricot. But werent there streets in the city that wound foreverinto the minute darkness? Werent there dreams where he methimself again and again,without ever seeming to wake? The sea is incommensurable. Each lungful of air kept dividing itself, even as the boat became a decimal point on the far horizon. 6. Bennie Wint, 20 Years after Faking His Drowning Death, is Discovered Alive, 2009 In the first years after I disappeared, I readevery report of drowning: children, mostly boys,mostly in their bathtubs,mostly accidents. Old men whose lungs filled with fluid while they sat in their armchairs. Fishermen. Swimmers. Immigrantscrowded onto rafts. Some men, their throats seize up, and they die without ever swallowing a drop,as if they never left the shore. Some nights I dreamedwhat never happened: I held my drowning in my palm like a giant pearl.Some days, standing behindthe cash register of my new life, I felt my lungs flatten out like a pairof discarded socks. Did I ever think of the woman I left on the shore as I kicked outpast the last of the breakers? I wont say.Here it was: I might have drownedtrying to pretend to.

{"text": "Syringa Orpheus liked the glad personal qualityOf the things beneath the sky. Of course, Eurydice was a part Of this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends Rocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks Cant withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon To the other, almost ready to give up wholeness. Then Apollo quietly told him: Leave it all on earth. Your lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to Follow, except a few birds of dusty feather,Not vivid performances of the past. But why not? All other things must change too.The seasons are no longer what they once were, But it is the nature of things to be seen only once,As they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along Somehow. Thats where Orpheus made his mistake. Of course Eurydice vanished into the shade;She would have even if he hadnt turned around.No use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel Of recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to utter an intelligentComment on the most thought-provoking element in its train. Only love stays on the brain, and something these people, These other ones, call life. Singing accuratelySo that the notes mount straight up out of the well of Dim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers Growing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulates The different weights of the things. But it isnt enough To just go on singing. Orpheus realized thisAnd didnt mind so much about his reward being in heaven After the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven Half out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them.Some say it was for his treatment of Eurydice.But probably the music had more to do with it, and The way music passes, emblematicOf life and how you cannot isolate a note of itAnd say it is good or bad. You mustWait till its over. The end crowns all,Meaning also that the tableauIs wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example, Melt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure That stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting; It is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal, Over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt, Harsh strokes. And to ask more than thisIs to become the tossing reeds of that slow,Powerful stream, the trailing grassesPlayfully tugged at, but to participate in the action No more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky Electric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth Into a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses Have each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks, Im a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me, Though I can understand the language of birds, and The itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me.Their jousting ends in music muchAs trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm And is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, day after day.But how late to be regretting all this, evenBearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late! To which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours, Replies that these are of course not regrets at all, Merely a careful, scholarly setting down ofUnquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way.And no matter how all this disappeared, Or got where it was going, it is no longer Material for a poem. Its subjectMatters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly While the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad Comet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward That the meaning, good or other, can never Become known. The singer thinksConstructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages Like a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away. The song is engulfed in an instant in blackness Which must in turn flood the whole continent With blackness, for it cannot see. The singer Must then pass out of sight, not even relieved Of the evil burthen of the words. Stellification Is for the few, and comes about much later When all record of these people and their lives Has disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm. A few are still interested in them. But what about So-and-so? is still asked on occasion. But they lie Frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorusSpeaks of a totally different incident with a similar name In whose tale are hidden syllablesOf what happened so long before thatIn some small town, one indifferent summer.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Ancestor It was a time when they were afraid of him.My father, a bare man, a gypsy, a horsewith broken knees no one would shoot.Then again, he was like the orange tree,and young women plucked from him sweet fruit.To meet him, you must be in the right place,even his sons and daughter, we wonderedwhere was papa now and what was he doing.He held the mystique of travelersthat pass your backyard and disappear into the trees.Then, when you follow, you find nothing,not a stir, not a twig displaced from its bough.And then he would appear one night.Half covered in shadows and half in light,his voice quiet, absorbing our unspoken thoughts.When his hands lay on the table at breakfast,they were hands that had not fixed our crumbling home,hands that had not taken us into themand the fingers did not gently rub along our lips.They were hands of a gypsy that filled our home with love and safety, for a moment;with all the shambles of boards and empty stomachs,they filled us because of the love in them.Beyond the ordinary love, beyond the coordinated life, beyond the sponging of broken hearts,came the untimely word, the fallen smile, the quiet tear,that made us grow up quick and romantic.Papa gave us something: when we paused from work,my sister fourteen years old working the cotton fields,my brother and I running like deer,we would pause, because we had a papa no one could catch,who spoke when he spoke and bragged and drank,he bragged about us: he did not say we were smart,nor did he say we were strong and were going to be rich someday. He said we were good. He held us up to the world for it to see,three children that were good, who understood love in a quiet way,who owned nothing but calloused hands and true freedom,and that is how he made us: he offered us to the wind,to the mountains, to the skies of autumn and spring.He said, Here are my children! Care for them!And he left again, going somewhere like a childwith a warriors heart, nothing could stop him.My grandmother would look at him for a long time,and then she would say nothing.She chose to remain silent, praying each night,guiding down like a root in the heart of earth,clutching sunlight and rains to her ancient breast.And I am the blossom of many nights.A threefold blossom: my sister is as she is,my brother is as he is, and I am as I am.Through sacred ceremony of living, daily living,arose three distinct hopes, three loves,out of the long felt nights and days of yesterday.", "label": "human"}

In the kingdom of Funnery, where jesters did reign, The monarch, Sir Chuckles, loved nothing but gain. His crown sat heavy, with mirth, not with gold, For his treasury was rich, but his story was told. Of the time the peasants, tired and worn, Decided their king was no longer forlorn. They planned a grand jest, a satire most bold, To teach Sir Chuckles, that for him, they wouldn't hold. The blacksmith, with hammer, and a fiery laugh, Promised to forge a new, golden staff. While the baker, with flour, and a rolling pin's might, Cured Sir Chuckles' bread of its endless blight. The farmer, with soil, and seeds from his hand, Gave the king a crop, that grew in his land. The tailor, with thread, stitched the king a new cloak, Embroidered with jokes, that made him choke. The minstrels, with lutes, played a merry tune, That had Sir Chuckles, dancing in June. The satirical play, a comedy of error, Branded the kingdom, the funniest in the theater. Yet Sir Chuckles learned, from his jesters' delight, To rule with a heart, as well as with might. For in the end, it wasn't gold that was dear, But laughter and love, that made life clear. And so the land of Funnery, did thrive and did grow, Under a king, who knew how to laugh and to bestow.

{"text": "A ghazal, my friend, you say? Yet comedy, a twist to play On form so old, steeped in the East, Its lines of couplets must not cease. A rhyme within each verse is due, A refrain - a name that rings true. O Sultan, the cat sat on your crown, Stealthy, sly, a royal frown. The marketplace abuzz, the name they called, \"Tabby the Throne-Taker!\" echoes enthralled. A poet, now, I claim not to be, Who crafted quatrains, stanzas free, Yet ghazals, they're made of couplets tight, A song of love, loss, and a burning night. A glass of wine, in the hand of a Sufi, A ghazal's end, with sincerity. Yet here we are, with laughter in heart, Where verses twirl, and jests impart. Two lovers met, 'midst a whirlwind spree, Their verse began, \"Under cherry blossom tree!\" And ended with, \"Ayub, our love's not dead,\" Their refrain - Ayub, the poet who once said. So now you see, a ghazal's form, Can dance, can jest, can break the norm. A last name lingers like a refrain, A comedic twist, amidst the pain.", "label": "machine"}

An odyssey unfolds in the ethereal night, Alone but boundless, in infant blackness bornour plight. Titan trudges forth, a lonely mariner, Charting starry seas, in a desolate sphere. Cosmic galleons drift, without mast or brine, Their helmsmen absent, halos lost in divine line. Orbiting empires where no daylight shall kindle, Sunless sentinels stand guard over land and fettle. By force of dark matter, their realms confined, No solar chariot crosses their domain, resigned. This Titan beholds, from his solemn outpost, Lifes fragile cradle; an island set adrift. Not of soil and river, nor mountains kissed by sky, But of stardust and secrets, where electrons lie. His vision, an archway of ceaseless time, Peering into the well of stars, sublime. Witnessing the birth of suns in fiery throes, And the weeping of nebulae in deathly repose. Through the lens of aeons, far deeper in chroma, Past the event horizon of space's vast stigma. The poet perceives patterns in celestial script, With quill forged from beauty, the cosmos now dripped.

The once proud towers, now decay, Stand as the ghosts of human dreams. Rivers run with murky gray, Their voices choked by forgotten screams. The earth, she wears her scars so wide, Each ruin tells a tale of pride. The fire that ravaged from inside, Our hearts, now just embers in the night. Yet life persists, in silent stride, In verdant sprouts and creatures' flight. In every end, a new begins, So sings the world, in whispered verse.

The knight, bold, with armor gleaming bright, His quest for love, a beacon alight. Through trials and storms, his courage held tight, To win a heart and find his rightful light. In the hush of twilight, they met, A love story, the stars would set. A whispered promise in the silent air, Two dreamers, their destinies laid bare. The maiden's smile, a gentle breeze that stirs, The knight's love, a flame that never blurs. In each other's gaze, their souls they confide, A silent oath, in the heart's abiding pride. For in this realm where shadows softly sway, And the moon's silver touch doth weave its lay, Their love, a tale that time shall not erase, In the annals of whispers, it finds its place. The knight to his maiden, day yields to night, In the caress of stars, their bond takes flight.

It weaves in half-truths and secrets, thick as midnight air, A symphony of murmurs, bound by a shroud of despair. Beneath the moon's wistful gaze, it dares to start impart, From ancient chests of heartache pounds against my heart. A tender echo of the soul's most secret sighs, Entwined within the rhythmic breath, it cannot deny. What tales might these whispers tell, of loves that rose and fell, Of bitter regrets and dreams, of pride and sorrows swell? Do they reveal the mysteries, that earth and stars conceal? Or do they speak of inner wars, where passion wounds and heals? Ah, whispers! How you humbly bend the ear that hears, With every breath, a sliver of a life that fills my spheres. The threads that bind the tapestry of all my yesterdays, We cannot see the whole, just the tangled skeins of maze. I pour myself into these chants, an alchemist's decree, To seek within their sibilance, the truth of what to be. Confessions spilled in iambic feet, to skies of azure stripe, A pilgrim lost in time, with every whispered trope. Respite not for hearts that yearn, nor solace comes to pass, In secret corners, where the echoes grow amass. For soon they rise again to surface with the dawn, A poets burden, heavy laden, too profound to shun. So here I stand, an ode to you, my whispered unseen friend, Through rhyme and verse, I strive to sift through yonder blend. To distill the purity, of stories lost and found, In this confessional poem, where my spirit is unbound. Ode to the Veil of Whispers In the realm where mystery prevails and truth so oft deceives, My heart, with quill and ink, confesses what it believes. Reforges steel.", "label": "machine"}

Cloaked in togas grace, they dared debate, As emperors donned crowns of withered vine, And whispered secrets of a love sedate. Yet, in the marketplace, where shadows twine, A merchant sold the dreams of ages past, With each exchange, the threads of fate align.
