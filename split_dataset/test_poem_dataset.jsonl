{"text": "Autumn Shade 1The autumn shade is thin. Grey leaves lie faintWhere they will lie, and, where the thick green was,Light stands up, like a presence, to the sky.The trees seem merely shadows of its age.From off the hill, I hear the logging crew,The furious and indifferent saw, the slowResponse of heavy pine; and I recallThat goddesses have died when their trees died.Often in summer, drinking from the spring,I sensed in its cool breath and in its voiceA living form, darker than any shadeAnd without feature, passionate, yet chillWith lust to fix in ice the buoyant rimAncient of days, the mother of us all.Now, toward his destined passion there, the strong,Vivid young man, reluctant, may returnFrom suffering in his own experienceTo lie down in the darkness. In this time,I stay in doors. I do my work. I sleep.Each morning, when I wake, I assent to wake.The shadow of my fist moves on this page,Though, even now, in the wood, beneath a bank,Coiled in the leaves and cooling rocks, the snakeDoes as it must, and sinks into the cold.2Nights grow colder. The Hunter and the BearFollow their tranquil course outside my window.I feel the gentian waiting in the wood,Blossoms waxy and blue, and blue-green stemsOf the amaryllis waiting in the garden.I know, as though I waited what they wait,The cold that fastens ice about the root,A heavenly form, the same in all its changes,Inimitable, terrible, and still,And beautiful as frost. Fire warms my room.Its light declares my books and pictures. Gently,A dead soprano sings Mozart and Bach.I drink bourbon, then go to bed, and sleepIn the Promethean heat of summers essence.3Awakened by some fear, I watch the sky.Compelled as though by purposes they know,The stars, in their blue distance, still affirmThe bond of heaven and earth, the ancient way.This old assurance haunts small creatures, dazedIn icy mud, though cold may freeze them thereAnd leave them as they are all summer long.I cannot sleep. Passion and consequence,The brutal given, and all I have desiredEvade me, and the lucid majestyThat warmed the dull barbarian to life.So I lie here, left with self-consciousness,Enemy whom I love but whom his changeAnd his forgetfulness again compel,Impassioned, toward my lost indifference,Faithful, but to an absence. Who shares my bed?Who lies beside me, certain of his waking,Led sleeping, by his own dream, to the day?4If I ask you, angel, will you come and leadThis ache to speech, or carry me, like a child,To riot? Ever young, you come of ageRemote, a pledge of distances, this pangI notice at dusk, watching you subsideFrom tree-tops and from fields. Mysterious self,Image of the fabulous alien,Even in sleep you summon me, even there,When, under his native tree, Odysseus hearsHis own incredible past and future, whisperedBy wisdom, but by wisdom in disguise.5Thinking of a bravura deed, a placeSacred to a divinity, an oldVerse that seems new, I postulate a manMastered by his own image of himself.Who is it says, I am? Sensuous angel,Vessel of nerve and blood, the impoverished heirOf an awareness other than his own?Not these, but one to come? For there he is,In a steel helmet, raging, fearing his death,Carrying bread and water to a quiet,Placing ten sounds together in one sound:Confirming his election, or merely still,Sleeping, or in a colloquy with the sun.6Snow and then rain. The roads are wet. A carSlips and strains in the mire, and I rememberDriving in France: weapons-carriers and jeeps;Our clothes and bodies stiffened by mud; our mindsDiverted from fear. We labor. Overhead,A plane, Berlin or Frankfurt, now New York.The car pulls clear. My neighbor smiles. He is old.Was this our wisdom, simply, in a chance,In danger, to be mastered by a task,Like groping round a chair, through a door, to bed?7A dormant season, and, under the dripping tree,Not sovereign, ordering nothing, letting the pastDo with me as it will, I savor placeAnd weather, air and sun. Though HerculesConfronts his nature in his deed, repeatsHis purposes, and is his will, intact,Magnificent, and memorable, I tryThe simplest forms of our old poverty.I seek no end appointed in my absenceBeyond the silence I already share.8I drive home with the books that I will read.The streets are harsh with traffic. Where I oncePlayed as a boy amid old stands of pine,Row after row of houses. Lined by the newDebris of wealth and power, the broken road.Then miles of red clay bank and frugal ground.At last, in the minor hills, my fathers place,Where I can find my way as in a thoughtGardens, the trees we planted, all we share.A Cherokee trail runs north to summer hunting.I see it, when I look up from the page.9In nameless warmth, sun light in every corner,Bending my body over my glowing book,I share the room. Is it with a voice or touchOr look, as of an absence, learned by love,Now, merely mine? Annunciation, specterOf the worn out, lost, or broken, telling what future.What vivid loss to come, you change the roomAnd him who reads here. Restless, he will stir,Look round, and see the room renewed and line,Color, and shape as, in desire, they are,Not shadows but substantial light, explicit,Bright as glass, inexhaustible, and true.1OMy shadow moves, until, at noon, I standWithin its seal, as in the finished past.But in the place where effect and cause are joined,In the warmth or cold of my remembering,Of love, of partial freedom, the time to beTrembles and glitters again in windy light.For nothing is disposed. The slow soft windTilting the blood-root keeps its gentle edge.The intimate cry, both sinister and tender,Once heard, is heard confined in its reserve.My image of myself, apart, informedBy many deaths, resists me, and I stayAlmost as I have been, intact, aware,Alive, though proud and cautious, even afraid.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A Forsaken Garden In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland, At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee, Walled round with rocks as an inland island, The ghost of a garden fronts the sea. A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses The steep square slope of the blossomless bed Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses Now lie dead. The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken, To the low last edge of the long lone land. If a step should sound or a word be spoken, Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand? So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless, Through branches and briars if a man make way, He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless Night and day. The dense hard passage is blind and stifled That crawls by a track none turn to climb To the strait waste place that the years have rifled Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time. The thorns he spares when the rose is taken; The rocks are left when he wastes the plain. The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken, These remain. Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not; As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry; From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not, Could she call, there were never a rose to reply. Over the meadows that blossom and wither Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song; Only the sun and the rain come hither All year long. The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath. Only the wind here hovers and revels In a round where life seems barren as death. Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping, Haply, of lovers none ever will know, Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping Years ago. Heart handfast in heart as they stood, \"Look thither,\" Did he whisper? \"look forth from the flowers to the sea; For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither, And men that love lightly may diebut we?\" And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened, And or ever the garden's last petals were shed, In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened, Love was dead. Or they loved their life through, and then went whither? And were one to the endbut what end who knows? Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither, As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose. Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them? What love was ever as deep as a grave? They are loveless now as the grass above them Or the wave. All are at one now, roses and lovers, Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea. Not a breath of the time that has been hovers In the air now soft with a summer to be. Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep, When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter We shall sleep. Here death may deal not again for ever; Here change may come not till all change end. From the graves they have made they shall rise up never, Who have left nought living to ravage and rend. Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing, While the sun and the rain live, these shall be; Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing Roll the sea. Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble, Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink, Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink, Here now in his triumph where all things falter, Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread, As a god self-slain on his own strange altar, Death lies dead.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Wild Tongue the Platonic idea is not only beauty, truth, and goodness, but the heavenly bed, created by God ... a heavenly man, a heavenly dog, a heavenly cat, and so on ... Bertrand Russell Were not all lesbians at this bar and grill (not yet? not practicing? only in heart?), chiaroscuro as the room is with expensive ambiance and dear cuts of meat and fish overlaid with nouveau fruit sauce, its clear that the most manly woman among us, older, wearing cowboy boots and a turquoise bolo, is probably neither entirely straight nor wholly queer. When she begins to confess her secret its her holding of a piece of land, acres of sweet desert; its muddy roads, its remote sublime have four-wheeled deep into her being. Shes probably someones heavenly grandmother, as Im still someones heavenly wife, despite the separation. Appearance does not really appear, but it appears to appear, yet, for a moment, it seems our conversation may open up unexpectedly or shatter into awkwardness over the word girlfriends: who in the rainy summers of our youths, we all played with our girlfriends, (what do I mean by girlfriend? what do you mean by yours?) Its only then, as one of the younger women (the most lovely, so silver with bracelets and earrings and a noticeable ring) laughs that I begin to guess her inclination, Does it really appear to appear, or only apparently appear to appear? Its a long way from Platos symposium to this bar and grill in Arizona. At that ancient feast whenever a number of individuals have a common name, they have also a common idea or formonly men reclined upon the couches, and the only the love of man for man was loves ideal, the impulse toward some boyish form becoming the ascension of being to some ever truer realm, as the souls of men became pregnant and gave birth to not only beauty, truth, and goodness, but the heavenly bed, created by God... a heavenly man, a heavenly dog, a heavenly cat, and so on through a whole Noahs ark, but no heavenly woman, much less a heavenly lesbian, for since Aristotle, Lesbian rule has meant that measure made of lead so it could be bent to a curved or crooked wall. Because we are all women, how can we speak of love? In the beginning, banished from the realm of discourse, assigned to loves servitude not its speech, to be loves body not its tongue, so no one here speaks of her feeling, much less thinks to make it anothers measure. In our mouths, the tongues a knife, each word a wild edge, where we stammer only our own wound, a drop of blood sensual on the tongue, a distinctive taste of salt, more mollusk perhapswrapped around an I of sand than pearl, a syllable of milk or nipple, some private body within the body, the you behind your eyes, as if being itself were poetrypassionate with nascent and protean neologism, full of the gaps of being, the oblique richness of a depth in which we begin to glimpse each other, mysterious and solo as we are, black stubborn pearls of being. If we spoke of Plato, and we dont; each of us was banished from the womb by virtue of having a womb, to this unpredictable realm where each of us would have to discover her self, that wild tonguenever delineated, even in shadow, upon the philosophers cave wall.", "label": "human"}

Natheless my longing loses not its green, It has so taken root in the hard stone Which talks and hears as though it were a lady. Utterly frozen is this youthful lady, Even as the snow that lies within the shade; For she is no more moved than is the stone By the sweet season which makes warm the hills And alters them afresh from white to green Covering their sides again with flowers and grass. When on her hair she sets a crown of grass The thought has no more room for other lady, Because she weaves the yellow with the green So well that Love sits down there in the shade, Love who has shut me in among low hills Faster than between walls of granite-stone. She is more bright than is a precious stone; The wound she gives may not be healed with grass: I therefore have fled far oer plains and hills For refuge from so dangerous a lady; But from her sunshine nothing can give shade, Not any hill, nor wall, nor summer-green. A while ago, I saw her dressed in green, So fair, she might have wakened in a stone This love which I do feel even for her shade; And therefore, as one woos a graceful lady, I wooed her in a field that was all grass Girdled about with very lofty hills. Yet shall the streams turn back and climb the hills Before Loves flame in this damp wood and green Burn, as it burns within a youthful lady, For my sake, who would sleep away in stone My life, or feed like beasts upon the grass, Only to see her garments cast a shade. How dark soeer the hills throw out their shade, Under her summer green the beautiful lady Covers it, like a stone coverd in grass.", "label": "human"}

Trees of the soberest hues, thick-leaved and tall, Arch it oerhead and column it around, Framing a covert, natural and wild,Domelike and dim; though nowhere so enclosed But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot Unwearied and unweakened. Sound is here A transient and unfrequent visitor;Yet if the day be calm, not often then, Whilst the high pines in one anothers arms Sleep, you may sometimes with unstartled ear Catch the far fall of voices, how remote You know not, and you do not care to know. The turf is soft and green, but not a flower Lights the recess, save one, star-shaped and brightI do not know its namewhich here and there Gleams like a sapphire set in emerald.A narrow opening in the branched roof,A single one, is large enough to show,With that half-glimpse a dreamer loves so much, The blue air and the blessing of the sky.Thither I always bent my idle steps,When griefs depressed, or joys disturbed my heart, And found the calm I looked for, or returned Strong with the quite rapture in my soul. But one day,One of those July days when winds have fled One knows not whither, I, most sick in mind With thoughts that shall be nameless, yet, no doubt, Wrong, or at least unhealthful, since though dark With gloom, and touched with discontent, they had No adequate excuse, nor cause, nor end,I, with these thoughts, and on this summer day, Entered the accustomed haunt, and found for once No medicinal virtue. Not a leafStirred with the whispering welcome which I sought, But in a close and humid atmosphere,Every fair plant and implicated boughHung lax and lifeless. Something in the place, Its utter stillness, the unusual heat,And some more secret influence, I thought, Weighed on the sense like sin. Above I saw, Though not a cloud was visible in heaven,The palid sky look through a glazed mistLike a blue eye in death. The change, perhaps, Was natural enough; my jaundiced sight,The weather, and the time explain it all:Yet have I drawn a lesson from the spot,And shrined it in these verses for my heart. Thenceforth those tranquil precincts I have sought Not less, and in all shades of various moods; But always shun to desecrate the spotBy weak repinings, sickly sentiments,Or inconclusive sorrows. Nature, thoughPure as she was in Eden when her breathKissed the white brow of Eve, doth not refuse,In her own way and with a just reserve, To sympathize with human suffering; But for the pains, the fever, and the fret Engendered of a weak, unquiet heart,She hath no solace; and who seeks her when These be the troubles over which he moans, Reads in her unreplying lineaments Rebukes, that, to the guilty consciousness, Strike like contempt.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Les Saltimbanques I was walking from the Louvre to Place Saint-Michel along the Seine when I noticed a crowd gathered under a large linden tree. As I approached I thought how much Id liked to walk down Unter den Linden when Id lived in Berlin, and now I saw again how attractive the light green seeds of the linden tree were against the darker green of the leaves. I was also agog to see what had caused the crowd to gather.As I neared I heard a mother say to her little boy, Regardez, Sebastien, les saltimbanques.Saltimbanques? This was a new word to me. I had a quick look on my iPhone and came up with the translation mountebank. I pushed my way as politely as possible through the crowd until I had a good view. It was a family of street performers. They had improvised a small stage on the wide pavement, and a father, mother, and ten-year-old or so boy were up there. The man was dressed in a striking yellow and blue outfit with white leggings and black shoes, and was banging a little drum rhythmically while the boy in a checked black-and-white jumpsuit capered about, playing thumb rolls on a tambourine, with a black-and-white dog dancing in perfect step alongside him. The woman dressed all in white sat on a stool playing quick dance music on a red tin whistle. On her head was a white floppy hat, sitting on which was a snowy owl who periodically flew in a circle over the heads of the crowd, coming back to land on the white hat. It was a scene worthy of being painted by the young Picasso, or the old Chagall. Or maybe by Gustave Dore. The boy on stage didnt look in the best of health, but I hoped I was wrong. The effect of the whole performance was strange and utterly charming. And the little troupe seemed to have emerged from another era from that of Baudelaire, even.I was puzzled by the translation offered by my iPhone, however. What I understood by the English word mountebank (which seemed very archaic) was either a person who sold quack medicines in public places, or a charlatan. These performers were no fakes. And yet, the English word, like the French, seemed to suggest the jumping up onto a stage. Id have to revisit my Shakespeare plays I seemed to remember that hed liked using that word.When the white hat came round I put a 20 note into it, took a quick photograph of les saltimbanques and made my way to the nearest metro.

They didnt want it collecting in their elbows or knees then popping up later. The girl who thought of the ponies made a lot of money. Now a months supply of pills came in a hard blue case with a handle. You opened it & found the usual vial plus six tiny ponies of assorted shapes & sizes, softly breathing in the Styrofoam. Often they had to be pried out & would wobble a little when first put on the ground. In the beginning the children tried to play with them, but the sharp hooves nicked their fingers & the ponies refused to jump over pencil hurdles. The children stopped feeding them sugarwater & the ponies were left to break their legs on the gardens gravel paths or drown in the gutters. On the first day of the month, rats gathered on doorsteps & spat out only the bitter manes. Many a ponys last sight was a bounding squirrel with its tail hovering over its head like a halo. Behind the movie theatre the hardier ponies gathered in packs amongst the cigarette butts, getting their hooves stuck in wads of gum. They lined the hills at funerals, huddled under folding chairs at weddings. It became a matter of pride if one of your ponies proved unusually sturdy. People would smile & say, This would have been an awful month for me, pointing to the glossy palomino trotting energetically around their ankles. Eventually, the ponies were no longer needed. People had learned to imagine their sadness trotting away. & when they wanted something more tangible, they could always go to the racetrack & study the larger horses faces.

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea. So twice five miles of fertile ground With walls and towers were girdled round; And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! A savage place! as holy and enchanted As eer beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover! And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced: Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, Or chaffy grain beneath the threshers flail: And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever It flung up momently the sacred river. Five miles meandering with a mazy motion Through wood and dale the sacred river ran, Then reached the caverns measureless to man, And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean; And mid this tumult Kubla heard from far Ancestral voices prophesying war! The shadow of the dome of pleasure Floated midway on the waves; Where was heard the mingled measure From the fountain and the caves. It was a miracle of rare device, A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice! A damsel with a dulcimer In a vision once I saw: It was an Abyssinian maid And on her dulcimer she played, Singing of Mount Abora. Could I revive within me Her symphony and song, To such a deep delight twould win me, That with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice!

A cryptic word left hanging in the air, Lends voice to the silent, testament rare. Eyes scour the canvas, searching for marks, Tales afoot that leave the strongest of hearts stark.

Grit clings to his soles, as he plots and he swears, Through the maze of the mind, amidst the shadows and the stares.

Buildings, like tombstones, in desolation stand, Marking the moments of a forsaken land. Nature, in whispers, reclaims her dominion, Over the skeletons of human ambition. What purpose remains in a realm stripped bare? When each breath is a whisper, a plea for air. The ashes of our dreams, scattered on the wind, Leave behind the questions, the doubts we must mind. Who are we now, in this endless expanse? Are we mere survivors, or just figures by chance? For in the eyes of time, with its unyielding gaze, The apathy of the cosmos unmasks our own haze. Yet amidst this void, where hope seems to die, A spark of existence refuses to comply. It dances in shadows, it glows in the night, A testament to will, to the strength of our fight. In the quiet, the poet finds a voice, a song, That the end of the world, to the end, won't belong. For though the earth may tremble and the stars may weep, Our tales, our love, in memory they'll seep. And though the lights may flicker and the warmth may fade, Our echoes will linger, in the darkness, they'll wade. And so we traverse this existential plane, In blank verse we speak, in truth, we remain.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the shadow of an ancient tree, where whispers weave through branches, a path curls like smoke, dancing between realms unseen. Footsteps echo gently, each step a question, each pause a sigh, the air thick with unspilled secrets. A lantern flickers, its flame a tiny sun, casting stories against the night, illuminating faces long forgotten. There, a mirror hangs fractured glass reflects the moon, showing not what is, but what might have been, distortions of dreams caught in times embrace. Leaves rustle, the sound of a thousand tales, whispers of wanderers, who chased shadows into dusk, only to find truth in the dark. A door appears, carved with symbols strange, a key forged in the fires of longing, waiting for hands that dare to reach. Beyond lies the unknown, a realm where fears unfurl, and destiny dances, where the heart seeks its echo, and the soul finds its song in the labyrinth of night.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In ancient halls of whispered lore, The present dances with the past, Two eras twine, forevermore. A tapestry of time's raw core, Woven tales that shadows cast, In ancient halls of whispered lore. Modern minds seek ancient store, Of knowledge lost, of lines so vast, Two eras twine, forevermore. In looped refrain, the mythologies pour, A cyclical play, echoes amassed, In ancient halls of whispered lore. The future's ink, history's quill implore, To write anew, the die is cast, Two eras twine, forevermore. From postmodern thought to ancient roar, We question all, the die is cast, In ancient halls of whispered lore, Two eras twine, forevermore.", "label": "machine"}
