{"text": "A Ballad: The Lake of the Dismal Swamp Written at Norfolk, in VirginiaThey made her a grave, too cold and dampFor a soul so warm and true;And shes gone to the Lake of the Dismal Swamp,Where, all night long, by a fire-fly lamp,She paddles her white canoe.And her fire-fly lamp I soon shall see,And her paddle I soon shall hear;Long and loving our life shall be,And Ill hide the maid in a cypress tree,When the footstep of death is near.Away to the Dismal Swamp he speedsHis path was rugged and sore,Through tangled juniper, beds of reeds,Through many a fen where the serpent feeds,And man never trod before.And when on the earth he sunk to sleep,If slumber his eyelids knew,He lay where the deadly vine doth weepIts venomous tear and nightly steepThe flesh with blistering dew!And near him the she-wolf stirrd the brake,And the copper-snake breathd in his ear,Till he starting cried, from his dream awake,Oh! when shall I see the dusky Lake,And the white canoe of my dear?He saw the Lake, and a meteor brightQuick over its surface playdWelcome, he said, my dear ones light!And the dim shore echoed for many a nightThe name of the death-cold maid.Till he hollowd a boat of the birchen bark,Which carried him off from shore;Far, far he followd the meteor spark,The wind was high and the clouds were dark,And the boat returnd no more.But oft, from the Indian hunters camp,This lover and maid so trueAre seen at the hour of midnight dampTo cross the Lake by a fire-fly lamp,And paddle their white canoe!", "label": "human"}

{"text": "A Rhapsody of a Southern Winter Night Oh! dost thou flatter falsely, Hope?The day hath scarcely passed that saw thy birth, Yet thy white wings are plumed to all their scope, And hour by hour thine eyes have gathered light, And grown so large and bright,That my whole future life unfolds what seems, Beneath their gentle beams,A path that leads athwart some guiltless earth, To which a star is dropping from the night! Not many moons ago,But when these leafless beds were all aglow With summers dearest treasures, IWas reading in this lonely garden-nook; A July noon was cloudless in the sky, And soon I put my shallow studies by; Then sick at heart, and angered by the book, Which, in good sooth, was but the long-drawn sigh Of some one who had quarreled with his kind, Vexed at the very proofs which I had sought, And all annoyed while all alert to find A plausible likeness of my own dark thought, I cast me down beneath yon oaks wide boughs, And, shielding with both hands my throbbing brows, Watched lazily the shadows of my brain. The feeble tide of peevishness went down, And left a flat dull waste of dreary pain Which seemed to clog the blood in every vein; The world, of course, put on its darkest frownIn all its realms I saw no mortal crown Which did not wound or crush some restless head; And hope, and will, and motive, all were dead. So, passive as a stone, I felt too lowTo claim a kindred with the humblest flower; Even that would bare its bosom to a shower, While I henceforth would take no pains to live, Nor place myself where I might feel or give A single impulse whence a wish could grow. There was a tulip scarce a gossamers throw Beyond that platanus. A little child,Most dear to me, looked through the fence and smiled A hint that I should pluck it for her sake. Ah, me! I trust I was not well awake The voice was very sweet,Yet a faint languor kept me in my seat.I saw a pouted lip, a toss, and heardSome low expostulating tones, but stirredNot even a leafs length, till the pretty fay, Wondering, and half abashed at the wild feat, Climbed the low pales, and laughed my gloom away.And here again, but led by other powers, A morning and a golden afternoon,These happy stars, and yonder setting moon, Have seen me speed, unreckoned and untasked, A round of precious hours.Oh! here, where in that summer noon I basked, And strove, with logic frailer than the flowers, To justify a life of sensuous rest,A question dear as home or heaven was asked, And without language answered. I was blest!Blest with those nameless boons too sweet to trust Unto the telltale confidence of song.Love to his own glad self is sometimes coy,And even thus much doth seem to do him wrong; While in the fears which chasten mortal joy, Is one that shuts the lips, lest speech too free, With the cold touch of hard reality,Should turn its priceless jewels into dust.Since that long kiss which closed the mornings talk, I have not strayed beyond this garden walk. As yet a vague delight is all I know,A sense of joy so wild t is almost pain,And like a trouble drives me to and fro,And will not pause to count its own sweet gain. I am so happy! that is all my thought! To-morrow I will turn it round and round, And seek to know its limits and its ground. To-morrow I will task my heart to learn The duties which shall spring from such a seed, And where it must be sown, and how be wrought. But oh! this reckless bliss is bliss indeed! And for one day I choose to seal the urn Wherein is shrined Loves missal and his creed. Meantime I give my fancy all it craves;Like him who found the West when first he caught The light that glittered from the world he sought,And furled his sails till Dawn should show the land; While in glad dreams he saw the ambient waves Go rippling brightly up a golden strand.Hath there not been a softer breath at play In the long woodland aisles than often sweepsAt this rough season through their solemn deepsA gentle Ariel sent by gentle May, Who knew it was the morn On which a hope was born, To greet the flower ere it was fully blown, And nurse it as some lily of her own? And wherefore, save to grace a happy day, Did the whole West at blushing sunset glow With clouds that, floating up in bridal snow, Passed with the festal eve, rose-crowned, away! And now, if I may trust my straining sight, The heavens appear with added stars to-night, And deeper depths, and more celestial height,Than hath been reached except in dreams or death. Hush, sweetest South! I love thy delicate breath; But hush! methought I felt an angels kiss! Oh! all that lives is happy in my bliss. That lonely fir, which always seemsAs though it locked dark secrets in itself, Hideth a gentle elf,Whose wand shall send me soon a frolic troop Of rainbow visions, and of moonlit dreams. Can joy be weary, that my eyelids droop? To-night I shall not seek my curtained nest, But even here find rest.Who whispered then? And what are they that peep Betwixt the foliage in the tree-top there? Come, Fairy Shadows! for the morn is near, When to your sombre pine ye all must creep; Come, ye wild pilots of the darkness, ere My spirit sinks into the gulf of Sleep; Even now it circles round and round the deep Appear!

For while they sit contriving, shall the rest, Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame, The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns By our delay? no, let us rather choose Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way, Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see Black fire and horror shot with equal rage Among his Angels; and his Throne it self Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire, His own invented Torments. But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumm not still, That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat: descent and fall To us is adverse. Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep, With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easie then; Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction: if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd In this abhorred deep to utter woe; Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge Inexorably, and the torturing hour Calls us to Penance? More destroy'd then thus We should be quite abolisht and expire. What fear we then? what doubt we to incense His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, Will either quite consume us, and reduce To nothing this essential, happier farr Then miserable to have eternal being: Or if our substance be indeed Divine, And cannot cease to be, we are at worst On this side nothing; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n, And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: Which if not Victory is yet Revenge. He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous To less then Gods. On th' other side up rose Belial, in act more graceful and humane; A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd For dignity compos'd and high exploit: But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear The better reason, to perplex and dash Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear, And with perswasive accent thus began. I should be much for open Warr, O Peers, As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success: When he who most excels in fact of Arms, In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution, as the scope Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd With Armed watch, that render all access Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection, to confound Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemy All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire Victorious. Thus repuls'd, our final hope Is flat despair: we must exasperate Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, And that must end us, that must be our cure, To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, Though full of pain, this intellectual being, Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, To perish rather, swallowd up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated night, Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, Let this be good, whether our angry Foe Can give it, or will ever? how he can Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, Belike through impotence, or unaware, To give his Enemies thir wish, and end Them in his anger, whom his anger saves To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe; Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the flames? or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague us? what if all Her stores were open'd, and this Firmament Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall One day upon our heads; while we perhaps Designing or exhorting glorious warr, Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; There to converse with everlasting groans, Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike My voice disswades; for what can force or guile With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides; Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. Shall we then live thus vile, the Race of Heav'n Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here Chains and these Torments? better these then worse By my advice; since fate inevitable Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe, Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, If we were wise, against so great a foe Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear What yet they know must follow, to endure Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd With what is punish't; whence these raging fires Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd In temper and in nature, will receive Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, If we procure not to our selves more woe. Thus Belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n We warr, if warr be best, or to regain Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then May hope when everlasting Fathe shall yeild To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife: The former vain to hope argues as vain The latter: for what place can be for us Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream We overpower? Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all, on promise made Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble, and receive Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne With warbl'd Hymns, and to his God head sing Forc't Halleluia's; while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, Our servile offerings. This must be our task In Heav'n this our delight; how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue By force impossible, by leave obtain'd Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek Our own good from our selves, and from our own Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, Free, and to none accountable, preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appeer Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse We can create, and in what place so e're Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain Through labour and indurance. This deep world Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd, And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell? As he our darkness, cannot we his Light Imitate when we please? This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; Nor want we skill or Art, from whence to raise Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more? Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements, these piercing Fires As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd Into their temper; which must needs remove The sensible of pain. All things invite To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State Of order, how in safety best we may Compose our present evils, with regard Of what we are and were, dismissing quite All thoughts of warr: ye have what I advise. He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain The sound of blustring winds, which all night long Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay After the Tempest: Such applause was heard As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas'd, Advising peace: for such another Field They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael Wrought still within them; and no less desire To found this nether Empire, which might rise By pollicy, and long process of time, In emulation opposite to Heav'n. Which when Beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, Satan except, none higher sat, with grave Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and public care; And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look Drew audience and attention still as Night Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote Inclines, here to continue, and build up here A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League Banded against his Throne, but to remaine In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd His captive multitude: For he, be sure In heighth or depth, still first and last will Reign Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part By our revolt, but over Hell extend His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n. What sit we then projecting peace and Warr? Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n To us enslav'd, but custody severe, And stripes, and arbitrary punishment Inflicted? and what peace can we return, But to our power hostility and hate, Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find Some easier enterprize? There is a place (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n Err not) another World, the happy seat Of some new Race call'd Man, about this time To be created like to us, though less In power and excellence, but favour'd more Of him who rules above; so was his will Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath, That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power, And where thir weakness, how attempted best, By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut, And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd The utmost border of his Kingdom, left To their defence who hold it: here perhaps Som advantagious act may be achiev'd By sudden onset, either with Hell fire To waste his whole Creation, or possess All as our own, and drive as we were driven, The punie habitants, or if not drive, Seduce them to our Party, that thir God May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand Abolish his own works. This would surpass Common revenge, and interrupt his joy In our Confusion, and our joy upraise In his disturbance; when his darling Sons HurI'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse Thir frail Original, and faded bliss, Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth Attempting, or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd By Satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, But from the Author of all ill could Spring So deep a malice, to confound the race Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve, done all to spite The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves His glory to augment. The bold design Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms And opportune excursion we may chance Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires Shall breathe her balme. But first whom shall we send In search of this new world, whom shall we find Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight Upborn with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick Of Angels watching round? Here he had need All circumspection, and we now no less Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, The weight of all and our last hope relies. This said, he sat; and expectation held His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd To second, or oppose, or undertake The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each In others count'nance read his own dismay Astonisht: none among the choice and prime Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found So hardie as to proffer or accept Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones, With reason hath deep silence and demurr Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light; Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, Outrageous to devour, immures us round Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant Barr'd over us prohibit all egress. These past, if any pass, the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into whatever world, Or unknown Region, what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd And judg'd of public moment, in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterr Mee from attempting. Wherefore do I assume These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour, due alike To him who Reigns, and so much to him due Of hazard more, as he above the rest High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty Powers, Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, While here shall be our home, what best may ease The present misery, and render Hell More tollerable; if there be cure or charm To respite or deceive, or slack the pain Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad Through all the Coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all: this enterprize None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose The Monarch, and prevented all reply, Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd Others among the chief might offer now (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; And so refus'd might in opinion stand His Rivals, winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; Thir rising all at once was as the sound Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone; and as a God Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n: Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, That for the general safety he despis'd His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd Loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, Or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal. Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre; If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn'd Firm concord holds, men onely disagree Of Creatures rational, though under hope Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: As if (which might induce us to accord) Man had not hellish foes anow besides, That day and night for his destruction waite. The Stygian Counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth In order came the grand infernal Peers, Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, And God-like imitated State; him round A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. Then of thir Session ended they bid cry With Trumpets regal sound the great result: Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers Disband, and wandring, each his several way Pursues, as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain The irksom hours, till this great Chief return. Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime Upon the wing, or in swift Race contend, As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields; Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir Spears Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when Alcides from Oechalia Crown'd With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th' Euboic Sea. Others more milde, Retreated in a silent valley, sing With notes Angelical to many a Harp Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. Thir Song was partial, but the harmony (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate, Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. Of good and evil much they argu'd then, Of happiness and final misery, Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm Pain for a while or anguish, and excite Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest With stubborn patience as with triple steel. Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps Might yield them easier habitation, bend Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, Lethe the River of Oblivion roules Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, Forthwith his former state and being forgets, Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Beyond this flood a frozen Continent Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, At certain revolutions all the damn'd Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. They ferry over this Lethean Sound Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, All in one moment, and so neer the brink; But Fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards The Ford, and of it self the water flies All taste of living wight, as once it fled The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous, O're many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe, Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, A Universe of death, which God by curse Created evil, for evil only good, Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable, and worse Than Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire. Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight; som times He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares Up to the fiery Concave touring high. As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring Thir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem'd Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass, Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, Impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire, Yet unconsum'd. Before the Gates there sat On either side a formidable shape; The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair, But ended foul in many a scaly fould Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd With mortal sting: about her middle round A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd, Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd than these Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd In secret, riding through the Air she comes Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape, If shape it might be call'd that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night, Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. Satan was now at hand, and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except, Created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd; And with disdainful look thus first began. Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance Thy miscreated Front athwart my way To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n. To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd, Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd To waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain? And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n, Hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment, False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, So speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold More dreadful and deform: on th' other side Incenst with indignation Satan stood Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd, That fires the length of Ophiucus huge In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands No second stroke intend, and such a frown Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on Over the Caspian, then stand front to front Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; For never but once more was either like To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung, Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, Against thy only Son? What fury O Son, Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom; For him who sits above and laughs the while At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute What e're his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore, then these to her Satan return'd: So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange Thou interposest, that my sudden hand Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends; till first I know of thee, What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st Me Father, and that Fantasm ca11'st my Son? I know thee not, nor ever saw till now Sight more detestable then him and thee. T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd; Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem Now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King, All on a sudden miserable pain Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid At first, and call'd me Sin, and for a Sign Portentous held me; but familiar grown, I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose, And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean: down they fell Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down Into this Deep, and in the general fall I also; at which time this powerful Key Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass Without my op'ning. Pensive here I sat Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. At last this odious offspring whom thou seest Thine own begotten, breaking violent way Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out Death; Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, Mee overtook his mother all dismaid, And in embraces forcible and foule Ingendring with me, of that rape begot These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd And hourly born, with sorrow infinite To me, for when they list into the womb That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw My Bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth A fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, That rest or intermission none I find. Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, And me his Parent would full soon devour For want of other prey, but that he knows His end with mine involvd; and knows that I Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd. But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, Save he who reigns above, none can resist. She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire, And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know I come no enemie, but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain, Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd Fell with us from on high: from them I go This uncouth errand sole, and one for all My self expose, with lonely steps to tread Th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense To search with wandring quest a place foretold Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now Created vast and round, a place of bliss In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't A race of upstart Creatures, to supply Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught Then this more secret now design'd, I haste To know, and this once known, shall soon return, And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. The key of this infernal Pit by due, And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King I keep, by him forbidden to unlock These Adamantine Gates; against all force Death ready stands to interpose his dart, Fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might. But what ow I to his commands above Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, To sit in hateful Office here confin'd, Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, Here in perpetual agonie and pain, With terrors and with clamors compasst round Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou My being gav'st me; whom should I obey But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss, among The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew, Which but her self not all the Stygian powers Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie With impetuous recoile and jarring sound Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook Of Erebus. She op'nd, but to shut Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood, That with extended wings a Bannerd Host Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. Before thir eyes in sudden view appear The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark Illimitable Ocean without bound, Without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth, And time and place are lost; where eldest Night And Chaos. Ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise Of endless Warrs, and by confusion stand. For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag Of each his Faction, in thir several Clanns, Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere, Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, And by decision more imbroiles the fray By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter Chance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss, The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more Worlds, Into this wild Abyss the warie fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while, Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal'd With noises loud and ruinous (to compare Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, With all her battering Engines bent to rase Som Capital City; or less then if this frame Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements In mutinie had from her Axle torn The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets A vast vacuitie: all unawares Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour Down had been falling, had not by ill chance The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither Sea, Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth Had from his wakeful custody purloind The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, With head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: At length a universal hubbub wilde Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, Undaunted to meet there what ever power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, And Discord with a thousand various mouths. T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, Chaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy, With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint Wandring this darksome Desart, as my way, Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King Possesses lately, thither to arrive I travel this profound, direct my course; Directed no mean recompence it brings To your behoof, if I that Region lost, All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce To her original darkness and your sway (Which is my present journey) and once more Erect the Standard there of ancient Night; Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old With faultring speech and visage incompos'd Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, That mighty leading Angel, who of late Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown. I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host Fled not in silence through the frighted deep With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here Keep residence; if all I can will serve, That little which is left so to defend, Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell: If that way be your walk, you have not farr; So much the neerer danger; go and speed; Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. He ceas'd; and Satan staid not to reply, But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, With fresh alacritie and force renew'd Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock Of fighting Elements, on all sides round Environ'd wins his way; harder beset And more endanger'd, then when Argo pass'd Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks: Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. So he with difficulty and labour hard Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; But hee once past, soon after when man fell, Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n, Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse With easie intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals, except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace. But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire As from her outmost works a brok'd foe With tumult less and with less hostile din, That Satan with less toil, and now with ease Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide In circuit, undetermind square or round, With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; And fast by hanging in a golden Chain This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.

Another country, too, its suns heat and lightas insistent as a pairof forceps. His pants, left crumpledon the beach, forged papersand a few hard candies in the pocket. Where the water was shallow, he could look down and see his shadow passing overthe pale sand, a wobbly twin, matching himstroke for stroke for stroke. 2. Li Po Drowns Trying to Embrace the Reflection of the Moon in the Yangtze, 762 The moon is no drinker of wine, so I mustcompensate. Surely youve heard the crows and nightingalesegging me on? The day has dispersedfrom the courtyards like a gang of sparrows, and nothing is left of the world that is notpecked-over, hard and dark as the dream of an apple seed. The young men laughat an old man drinkingalone, but here are my companions: my shadow, as loyal and thin as a starved dog, and the moon, his whole face wrinkling with laughter. 3. Bob, the Circus Seal, Drowns Himself in His Tank in Galveston, 1911 By then his teeth had rotted out, and he often turned to his ownerwith his mouth open as if about to speak, a ruined smelljetting from inside. He had already attempted it, three days before,but his owner dove in and pulled him uponto the slimy planks. His circus show days were long gone. Sure, some afternoonsa kid might walk by and see the scabby painting on the side of the building: the hoop,the pedestal, the ghostof a man in a top hat, the striped ball now like a clotof pus streakedwith blood, hovering over the sleek, dark head. 4. Natalie Wood Drowns under Mysterious Circumstances near Santa Catalina Island, 1981 Let me tell you: death is a long silk glovedropped to the floor. It doesnt remember the heftof the arm, the fingers dancing. That limb is gone, and nothingwill hold its shape again. You twirl your pastel skirt. You watchtwo carsrace toward the cliff, and there is nothing you can do. So many lives youve enteredlike a room: swooned, held the prop pistolto your own face, sangfor the back row. But was it your voice? What was that nameyou were born into? Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko?What happened to her? Was she the onetaken, her family butchered, livinganother lifeamong the enemy people? Was it the morning?when she stopped scanningthe horizon for rescuers that she turned into you? 5. Hippasus of Metapontum Is Drowned at Sea for the Heresy of Discovering Irrational Numbers, ca. 500 BCE His fellow Pythagoreans had already builta shrine to his memory and placed it where he passed by every day, but he did not take the hint. It was on the shipthat they seized him. God was an integer, firmas an unripe apricot. But werent there streets in the city that wound foreverinto the minute darkness? Werent there dreams where he methimself again and again,without ever seeming to wake? The sea is incommensurable. Each lungful of air kept dividing itself, even as the boat became a decimal point on the far horizon. 6. Bennie Wint, 20 Years after Faking His Drowning Death, is Discovered Alive, 2009 In the first years after I disappeared, I readevery report of drowning: children, mostly boys,mostly in their bathtubs,mostly accidents. Old men whose lungs filled with fluid while they sat in their armchairs. Fishermen. Swimmers. Immigrantscrowded onto rafts. Some men, their throats seize up, and they die without ever swallowing a drop,as if they never left the shore. Some nights I dreamedwhat never happened: I held my drowning in my palm like a giant pearl.Some days, standing behindthe cash register of my new life, I felt my lungs flatten out like a pairof discarded socks. Did I ever think of the woman I left on the shore as I kicked outpast the last of the breakers? I wont say.Here it was: I might have drownedtrying to pretend to. I had to swimso far out, then mark a different beachand swim back a different man, without knowingif his strength was enough to carry me to shore.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Tulips The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in. I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietlyAs the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as waterTends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggageMy patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.I didnt want any flowers, I only wantedTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.How free it is, you have no idea how freeThe peacefulness is so big it dazes you,And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet. The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind meWhere once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.Before they came the air was calm enough,Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closesIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,And comes from a country far away as health.", "label": "human"}

Lights witness one by one all over what still abides. There was no one better. Her town, her town, her town, the tires repeat as we go by.5For those my friends who want me to know, to discover and combine: all my best thoughts I roll up and let fall carelessly.

{"text": "The Negativo Trio NO was a violin, NOT a viola, and NEVER a cello. They were noble instruments, but highly nonconformist. Prickly in personality, if sexy. Wayward. Always went in their own direction. Made odd choices. Loved the difficult. Naysayed the popular. Collectively unified in a single reaction to the mainstream: negative. When they first chanced to come together, they doubted they would ever meld. But the minute they began to make music, they discovered a numinous core to their triangle. They couldnt see this core, smell it, or touch itand neither could their slender audience (thirty people on folding chairs in a church). But all felt it was a natural union of sound, nimble and sublime. That night they became the Negativo Trio. Retiring to nestle in the velvet warmth of their cases, they whispered to each other, debriefing and musing in the first of many nightly pajama parties. This very first evening they discovered that what they wanted above all were two things. One was to play their music with the very nacre of its nature, and the other was fame. Night after night they played. Increased their bookings. Recorded. And were downloaded. They raised money to pay off the debt of their obscure choices. On stage they each shone with the patina of centuries: maple, spruce, and willow with an elegant varnish of gum arabic, honey, and the whites of eggs. But they werent famous, even though they played a nocturne as if every note were a black pearl. Yet NO, NOT and NEVER did everything everyone advised them to be famous: they networked, they nodded nicely to publicists, they flashed their Negativo news on social media. But the fact was, the trio wasnt for everybody. Do you think its our name? NOT the Viola asked. Would we be more famous as the Nightingale Trio? Nope, said NEVER the Cello. Negativo has our brio. And NEVER was right. The three of them played with nerve. The knottier the piece, the better. They made their audiences reach. We should be sexier, NO the Violin said. Naughtier. Its our propensity for the minor key; we should lighten it up. But when they played in the minor key, their audiences felt they had arrived at the navel of the universe. The instruments could never give up the minor. Would the Negativos ever learn what the people in the seats knew? The trio wasnt famous because, well, they kind of unnerved people. You had to have nettle to take them on. Though they certainly wouldnt have said no to notoriety, eventually they had to admit that they could not surrender their quirks. We will never be famous, NEVER said one night after they had nestled in their cases for their midnight debriefing. Im nauseous, said NO extravagantly. And neglected, said NOT excessively. Never, said NEVER decisively. They would never fill the biggest halls. Or be the first name on the tips of tongues. And with the inverted logic of misplaced dreams, even though they had toured, had notched up review, and had triumphs and fans, and websites and bloggers, and a body of criticism devoted to them, they felt they had reached their nadir. The next morning they couldnt seem to get up. They lay immobile, as if their velvet-lined cases were coffins. A netherworldly silence descended. The dust of despair drifted through the crack between the case tops and bottoms onto these living dead. Time dragged like a dirty hem. Naught into Nil. Desolation into Dormancy. Dormancy into . . . . . . Rest. Rest into Snoozing. Snoozing into Sleep. Sleep into Healing. The nostrum of sleep lasted until the pinkish light that heralds spring. A noisy nuthatch drilled for insects in a nearby tree. It was a forest sound, yodel-y and ebullient. It awoke the maple and spruce and willow of the Negativos constitutions. Their bodies couldnt help responding to the vernal signal given when spring utters its only word: Nevertheless. If not fame, nevertheless music. Numbskull nuthatch! NEVER growled. Ninny nuthatch, NO yawned. Bumptious bird, NOT shifted, inadvertently jostling the snap to the dusty case. It sprang open. NO unclicked and climbed out, too. And NEVER heaved the lid. They played immediately of course, trying a violin piece by the underrated Nardini. Most thought him a lightweight, but the Negativos gave it their signature interpretation of naked necessity. Oh it was NOTHING, they began to say to one another as they did musical favors for themselves, producing scores of synchronicities and the occasional juicy nihilistic dissonance. They buoyed on their notes, as if a midnight Pacific of calm, rich, dark negatives were effused with luminescence. How relieved their listeners were to have them back. Again their audiences were made aware of the noses between their ears. That slight, brief piquancy in the nostrils was the smell of earthly harmony. It came from within the airy column that united the instruments, the nucleus of their refusal to suit. Such accord, though it is as rare as ease, seems like nothing. And so the Negativo Trio was known as a trios trio. Not famous, but known. Contrary to the vicissitudes of fame, ease is the path of the known, smooth as the satin of the instruments finish. To be recognized, yet not to suffer the disadvantages of fame, is a state so ideal it is the pinnacle of a career. NO, NOT and NEVER had at last woken up to that.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Building of the Ship \"Build me straight, O worthy Master! Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel, That shall laugh at all disaster, And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!\" The merchant's word Delighted the Master heard; For his heart was in his work, and the heart Giveth grace unto every Art. A quiet smile played round his lips, As the eddies and dimples of the tide Play round the bows of ships, That steadily at anchor ride. And with a voice that was full of glee, He answered, \"Erelong we will launch A vessel as goodly, and strong, and stanch, As ever weathered a wintry sea!\" And first with nicest skill and art, Perfect and finished in every part, A little model the Master wrought, Which should be to the larger plan What the child is to the man, Its counterpart in miniature; That with a hand more swift and sure The greater labor might be brought To answer to his inward thought. And as he labored, his mind ran o'er The various ships that were built of yore, And above them all, and strangest of all Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall, Whose picture was hanging on the wall, With bows and stern raised high in air, And balconies hanging here and there, And signal lanterns and flags afloat, And eight round towers, like those that frown From some old castle, looking down Upon the drawbridge and the moat. And he said with a smile, \"Our ship, I wis, Shall be of another form than this!\" It was of another form, indeed; Built for freight, and yet for speed, A beautiful and gallant craft; Broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast, Pressing down upon sail and mast, Might not the sharp bows overwhelm; Broad in the beam, but sloping aft With graceful curve and slow degrees, That she might be docile to the helm, And that the currents of parted seas, Closing behind, with mighty force, Might aid and not impede her course. In the ship-yard stood the Master, With the model of the vessel, That should laugh at all disaster, And with wave and whirlwind wrestle! Covering many a rood of ground, Lay the timber piled around; Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak, And scattered here and there, with these, The knarred and crooked cedar knees; Brought from regions far away, From Pascagoula's sunny bay, And the banks of the roaring Roanoke! Ah! what a wondrous thing it is To note how many wheels of toil One thought, one word, can set in motion! There 's not a ship that sails the ocean, But every climate, every soil, Must bring its tribute, great or small, And help to build the wooden wall! The sun was rising o'er the sea, And long the level shadows lay, As if they, too, the beams would be Of some great, airy argosy, Framed and launched in a single day. That silent architect, the sun, Had hewn and laid them every one, Ere the work of man was yet begun. Beside the Master, when he spoke, A youth, against an anchor leaning, Listened, to catch his slightest meaning. Only the long waves, as they broke In ripples on the pebbly beach, Interrupted the old man's speech. Beautiful they were, in sooth, The old man and the fiery youth! The old man, in whose busy brain Many a ship that sailed the main Was modelled o'er and o'er again; The fiery youth, who was to be The heir of his dexterity, The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand, When he had built and launched from land What the elder head had planned. \"Thus,\" said he, \"will we build this ship! Lay square the blocks upon the slip, And follow well this plan of mine. Choose the timbers with greatest care; Of all that is unsound beware; For only what is sound and strong To this vessel shall belong. Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine Here together shall combine. A goodly frame, and a goodly fame, And the Union be her name! For the day that gives her to the sea Shall give my daughter unto thee!\" The Master's word Enraptured the young man heard; And as he turned his face aside, With a look of joy and a thrill of pride Standing before Her father's door, He saw the form of his promised bride. The sun shone on her golden hair, And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair, With the breath of morn and the soft sea air. Like a beauteous barge was she, Still at rest on the sandy beach, Just beyond the billow's reach; But he Was the restless, seething, stormy sea! Ah, how skilful grows the hand That obeyeth Love's command! It is the heart, and not the brain, That to the highest doth attain, And he who followeth Love's behest Far excelleth all the rest! Thus with the rising of the sun Was the noble task begun, And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds Were heard the intermingled sounds Of axes and of mallets, plied With vigorous arms on every side; Plied so deftly and so well, That, ere the shadows of evening fell, The keel of oak for a noble ship, Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong, Was lying ready, and stretched along The blocks, well placed upon the slip. Happy, thrice happy, every one Who sees his labor well begun, And not perplexed and multiplied, By idly waiting for time and tide! And when the hot, long day was o'er, The young man at the Master's door Sat with the maiden calm and still, And within the porch, a little more Removed beyond the evening chill, The father sat, and told them tales Of wrecks in the great September gales, Of pirates coasting the Spanish Main, And ships that never came back again, The chance and change of a sailor's life, Want and plenty, rest and strife, His roving fancy, like the wind, That nothing can stay and nothing can bind, And the magic charm of foreign lands, With shadows of palms, and shining sands, Where the tumbling surf, O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar, Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar, As he lies alone and asleep on the turf. And the trembling maiden held her breath At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea, With all its terror and mystery, The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death, That divides and yet unites mankind! And whenever the old man paused, a gleam From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume The silent group in the twilight gloom, And thoughtful faces, as in a dream; And for a moment one might mark What had been hidden by the dark, That the head of the maiden lay at rest, Tenderly, on the young man's breast! Day by day the vessel grew, With timbers fashioned strong and true, Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee, Till, framed with perfect symmetry, A skeleton ship rose up to view! And around the bows and along the side The heavy hammers and mallets plied, Till after many a week, at length, Wonderful for form and strength, Sublime in its enormous bulk, Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk! And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing, Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething Caldron, that glowed, And overflowed With the black tar, heated for the sheathing. And amid the clamors Of clattering hammers, He who listened heard now and then The song of the Master and his men: \"Build me straight, O worthy Master, Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel, That shall laugh at all disaster, And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!\" With oaken brace and copper band, Lay the rudder on the sand, That, like a thought, should have control Over the movement of the whole; And near it the anchor, whose giant hand Would reach down and grapple with the land, And immovable and fast Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast! And at the bows an image stood, By a cunning artist carved in wood, With robes of white, that far behind Seemed to be fluttering in the wind. It was not shaped in a classic mould, Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old, Or Naiad rising from the water, But modelled from the Master's daughter! On many a dreary and misty night, 'T will be seen by the rays of the signal light, Speeding along through the rain and the dark, Like a ghost in its snow-white sark, The pilot of some phantom bark, Guiding the vessel, in its flight, By a path none other knows aright! Behold, at last, Each tall and tapering mast Is swung into its place; Shrouds and stays Holding it firm and fast! Long ago, In the deer-haunted forests of Maine, When upon mountain and plain Lay the snow, They fell, those lordly pines! Those grand, majestic pines! 'Mid shouts and cheers The jaded steers, Panting beneath the goad, Dragged down the weary, winding road Those captive kings so straight and tall, To be shorn of their streaming hair, And naked and bare, To feel the stress and the strain Of the wind and the reeling main, Whose roar Would remind them forevermore Of their native forests they should not see again. And everywhere The slender, graceful spars Poise aloft in the air, And at the mast-head, White, blue, and red, A flag unrolls the stripes and stars. Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless, In foreign harbors shall behold That flag unrolled, 'T will be as a friendly hand Stretched out from his native land, Filling his heart with memories sweet and endless! All is finished! and at length Has come the bridal day Of beauty and of strength. To-day the vessel shall be launched! With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched, And o'er the bay, Slowly, in all his splendors dight, The great sun rises to behold the sight. The ocean old, Centuries old, Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled, Paces restless to and fro, Up and down the sands of gold. His beating heart is not at rest; And far and wide, With ceaseless flow, His beard of snow Heaves with the heaving of his breast. He waits impatient for his bride. There she stands, With her foot upon the sands, Decked with flags and streamers gay, In honor of her marriage day, Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending, Round her like a veil descending, Ready to be The bride of the gray old sea. On the deck another bride Is standing by her lover's side. Shadows from the flags and shrouds, Like the shadows cast by clouds, Broken by many a sunny fleck, Fall around them on the deck. The prayer is said, The service read, The joyous bridegroom bows his head; And in tears the good old Master Shakes the brown hand of his son, Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek In silence, for he cannot speak, And ever faster Down his own the tears begin to run. The worthy pastor The shepherd of that wandering flock, That has the ocean for its wold, That has the vessel for its fold, Leaping ever from rock to rock Spake, with accents mild and clear, Words of warning, words of cheer, But tedious to the bridegroom's ear. He knew the chart Of the sailor's heart, All its pleasures and its griefs, All its shallows and rocky reefs, All those secret currents, that flow With such resistless undertow, And lift and drift, with terrible force, The will from its moorings and its course. Therefore he spake, and thus said he: \"Like unto ships far off at sea, Outward or homeward bound, are we. Before, behind, and all around, Floats and swings the horizon's bound, Seems at its distant rim to rise And climb the crystal wall of the skies, And then again to turn and sink, As if we could slide from its outer brink. Ah! it is not the sea, It is not the sea that sinks and shelves, But ourselves That rock and rise With endless and uneasy motion, Now touching the very skies, Now sinking into the depths of ocean. Ah! if our souls but poise and swing Like the compass in its brazen ring, Ever level and ever true To the toil and the task we have to do, We shall sail securely, and safely reach The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining beach The sights we see, and the sounds we hear, Will be those of joy and not of fear!\" Then the Master, With a gesture of command, Waved his hand; And at the word, Loud and sudden there was heard, All around them and below, The sound of hammers, blow on blow, Knocking away the shores and spurs. And see! she stirs! She starts, she moves, she seems to feel The thrill of life along her keel, And, spurning with her foot the ground, With one exulting, joyous bound, She leaps into the ocean's arms! And lo! from the assembled crowd There rose a shout, prolonged and loud, That to the ocean seemed to say, \"Take her, O bridegroom, old and gray, Take her to thy protecting arms, With all her youth and all her charms!\" How beautiful she is! How fair She lies within those arms, that press Her form with many a soft caress Of tenderness and watchful care! Sail forth into the sea, O ship! Through wind and wave, right onward steer! The moistened eye, the trembling lip, Are not the signs of doubt or fear. Sail forth into the sea of life, O gentle, loving, trusting wife, And safe from all adversity Upon the bosom of that sea Thy comings and thy goings be! For gentleness and love and trust Prevail o'er angry wave and gust; And in the wreck of noble lives Something immortal still survives! Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State! Sail on, O Union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate! We know what Master laid thy keel, What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel, Who made each mast, and sail, and rope, What anvils rang, what hammers beat, In what a forge and what a heat Were shaped the anchors of thy hope! Fear not each sudden sound and shock, 'T is of the wave and not the rock; 'T is but the flapping of the sail, And not a rent made by the gale! In spite of rock and tempest's roar, In spite of false lights on the shore, Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea! Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee, Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears, Our faith triumphant o'er our fears, Are all with thee, are all with thee!", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Ancestor It was a time when they were afraid of him.My father, a bare man, a gypsy, a horsewith broken knees no one would shoot.Then again, he was like the orange tree,and young women plucked from him sweet fruit.To meet him, you must be in the right place,even his sons and daughter, we wonderedwhere was papa now and what was he doing.He held the mystique of travelersthat pass your backyard and disappear into the trees.Then, when you follow, you find nothing,not a stir, not a twig displaced from its bough.And then he would appear one night.Half covered in shadows and half in light,his voice quiet, absorbing our unspoken thoughts.When his hands lay on the table at breakfast,they were hands that had not fixed our crumbling home,hands that had not taken us into themand the fingers did not gently rub along our lips.They were hands of a gypsy that filled our home with love and safety, for a moment;with all the shambles of boards and empty stomachs,they filled us because of the love in them.Beyond the ordinary love, beyond the coordinated life, beyond the sponging of broken hearts,came the untimely word, the fallen smile, the quiet tear,that made us grow up quick and romantic.Papa gave us something: when we paused from work,my sister fourteen years old working the cotton fields,my brother and I running like deer,we would pause, because we had a papa no one could catch,who spoke when he spoke and bragged and drank,he bragged about us: he did not say we were smart,nor did he say we were strong and were going to be rich someday. He said we were good. He held us up to the world for it to see,three children that were good, who understood love in a quiet way,who owned nothing but calloused hands and true freedom,and that is how he made us: he offered us to the wind,to the mountains, to the skies of autumn and spring.He said, Here are my children! Care for them!And he left again, going somewhere like a childwith a warriors heart, nothing could stop him.My grandmother would look at him for a long time,and then she would say nothing.She chose to remain silent, praying each night,guiding down like a root in the heart of earth,clutching sunlight and rains to her ancient breast.And I am the blossom of many nights.A threefold blossom: my sister is as she is,my brother is as he is, and I am as I am.Through sacred ceremony of living, daily living,arose three distinct hopes, three loves,out of the long felt nights and days of yesterday.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Man Who Drowned in the Irrigation Ditch She always got mad at himevery time he came home in the middle of the morningwith his pant legs wet.She knew he had fallen in the ditch again.His legs were not strong enough to be straddling ditches.He was too old to be walking over temporary dikes.She wished he didnt do that, but sometimes he had to.She sometimes imagined him falling over backward in one of the irrigation ditches,his head hitting hard cement,his body slowly sinking into the water.Water that was only three feet deep.A harmless three feet of water,where children played,and ladies sometimes sat and dipped their feet,especially on hot summer evening.She knew he would drown,she knew it was bound to happen sometime.As far as the eye could see,flat, green fields appearing to end at the foot of distant mountains.Mountains, a reminder of what the fields once looked like.Fields saturated with water pulled from its secret storage placebeneath the earths surface.We are called the people of the cotton fieldsbecause of the labor our families did.For us there was no reservation, no Housing & Urban Development, no tribal support.We were a people segregated in row housesall lined up along the roads of our labor.It is a muggy summer evening.My father, my sister, and I sit on the east side of the house finding shade against the still-hot setting sun.The change from brilliant white sun to blue and gold sunset and finally,to warm darkness, a change we anticipate for brief relief.On this evening the anticipation is shattered.A boy comes to the house. He gestures for my father to come to him, out of our hearing.With what the boy says to him my father moves quickly.As quickly as his stiff back and legs can move him.Back and legs broken and fused from when he was a cowboy.He rushes by, throwing the kitchen door open, grabbing his hat.He gets into his truck and drives away.We pay him no mind other than for the fact that he is rushing.A second later my mother comes out of the house and with a single motion pulls her apron off.In a tone I recognize as signifying something is wrong, she instructs us to come with her.She starts in the direction of a cotton field a few hundred yards from our house.My sister and I walk beside her.Saying nothing.Her hands wring the towel she carries with her.This towel, a multipurpose kind of thing.Women carry it to fan themselves,to wipe sweat, to cover their heads and eyes from the sunlight, to shoo away kids, dogs, flies.I remember once a student of mine, out of habit, brought her towel with her to summer school at the university.Whenever we see each other on campus during a summer session we always laugh about it.We continue to walk, stepping over the ends of rows of cotton.Rows of cotton my family and I know well.In early summer we walk the rows to thin out the growth,and later we walk to chop the weeds somehow immune to chemicals.And in the winter, at least before the machinery, we pick the cotton from their stalks.Now I cant begin to imagine how many miles we have all walked,up and back, up and back along these rows.We walk alongside her.The setting sun maintains a continuous pounding on our backs,the humidity from the damp fields is warm, it rests on our shoulders like tired, sweaty arms.She heads toward the irrigation ditch.The ditch is dirt, not cement, it is wide, muddy, and slippery.The water is shallow.I see my fathers truck pulling up on the opposite side.In the front seat there are women, and in the back, men.The men wedge their feet in between plastic and aluminum irrigation pipes, mud-caked shovels, boots, and hoes.Equipment in the back of his truck all for the purposes of working fields.I remember the hoe he carried.It was big, with a blade that held an edge well and got the work done.I recall purchasing a hoe for my home and being particularly unsatisfied with the craftsmanship.They call this a hoe? I said to my husband. It had a skinny neck, and no blade to speak of.The handle was too thin, causing blisters.Once in awhile I look around for the type of hoe my father carried. I found one once, but didnt have money to buy it.In slow motion,weighed down by the heat,the women begin to slide across the bench of the pickup truck.They slowly step out of the cab, appearing as a single long strand of woman, emerging.In cautious unison they walk toward the edge of the ditch.My mother, as if connected to them by an invisible string,is pulled toward them from the opposite side.Their movement is dreamlike. They peer into the muddy water.And as if with a shared nervous system, their hands motion the towel each is carrying,motion it to just above their eyes, covering their faces.With a single vocal act they release from their depths a hard, deep, mournful wail.This sound breaks the wave of bright summer light above the green cotton fields.", "label": "human"}

And when the giant with three teeth harangues us to hurry up,what comfort to know hes a friend, what pleasure to be agreeable,small wonders of acquiescence, like obedient pets.

{"text": "Proportion Surviving Long before the fresh apple crisis, my life had some form to it. I would wake in the morningsI would perform something. For example, the day I tried, as one with acute passion might, to win one woman over but accidentally won anotherthat whole time I had been living like someone. Though I cant remember his name. His model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that I inhabit in time of need. This time the need was surprising. People tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk. And apples take their shape naturally. The guy, whose name escapes me now, taught me to look upon others concerns as mine to make at home. I was fond of doing many things at home, but my favorite was drinking juice. When my friends came bythey liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands, thinking they knew what I needed and planning to force it on meI had to tell them I was busy with my juice. Two weeks before the crisis, I had been writing some poems about it. It was a warm day, not entirely different from other warm days in San Francisco. People were on the street. Pale people were on the street, making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned. The poems I had written were failures, but dense ones. It seemed appropriate to think the persons attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps, which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people. I had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain, but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers cant help but enjoy. That day I had, in a sense, gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them. I awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for somethingnot anything life threatening, but definitely personal. My lover, then, wanted to spend much of her life asleep. She had no ostensible reaction to the citys sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them. In a world where a persons tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets, I could not find four people who cared. I thought that if I could find those four people we could really do something. A few of my friends pretended they were chosen. A few neighbors felt bad and made offers. My mother called to console me. My loverin actuality, the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop, slept next to me. Sleep became our network: falling in and out of it for change. The rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time. So I kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness. If by morning I could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing, she would reward me. Before the crisis, the reward would have needed only to be an apple one. But after the apples were gone. The landscape usually contains the solution to whats lost. Demographics help people in cars. Some people did not notice me. Some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me. That was two days before. The evening before it was two days before the crisis, I was thinking that I did not think I was asleep. I had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemates cat in it. When I looked again, there was no lightbut I had not been asleep. Its the way people react to traumatic events. They say, I had just been there or will say, She was just with me. So the loss of light was emotional and the lost statedemographic. I began to trace things by their disappearance. Alone in the room, my memory, and anticipated darkness going for light. People like to talk about the daytime. People in strange moods often miss the daytime. Before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods. I had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste. I was happy. I mean, I was in my juice. Five weeks before the crisis, I was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house. I did not really work there, but I went there every week. All but the third Sunday of each month, I would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale. Not to buy, but to stand next to. Shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs. That was one thing. I would stand there and be something for taller people who couldnt see. I had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed. My parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere. My father would always say, If youre not going to be a people person, then numbers will have to do. He was surprised that with all the time I had on my hands, I chose to spend most of it alone. Numbers then did hold some mystery for me, but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore. For years I had known that if there was a wall between where I was and where I needed to be, I did not want it there. Some people have personal goals that are demanding. Certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed. My decision to drink only fresh juice, which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast, kept me busy rounding up cash. I would have to leave most friendships behind. As a way of keeping my life wall-free, I had to divide my time. I would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories. The second part of my day I would spend telling people about the first part. The other parts are not of substance here. Twenty-five years before the crisis I had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice. Twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany. I am always drinking in my poems, a good friend says. In the first years of my life, everything I ate was mush. Today I will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this. When I had that remarkable glass of apple juice, I had no idea that one day I simply would not be able to find it. The city gets rid of its apples. People find themselves inventing fruit. The day I decided to write poems about itit was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverageI had been resting in my best friends easy chair. We were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me. Five days later I had twenty poems. When a person writes a poem about her passions, people on the street are bound to notice them. The passions overwhelm the body. She carries the body as though it were the book. The friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week, and though I miss her it was the failures that saved me. On every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful. If certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water, with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall, whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall. The person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly. In the alley behind the natural foods grocery, I met my second lover for the first time. Meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later. Or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present. And the weather was so hot during the crisis. Only the alleys had shade. Forty-eight days into the crisis, while on a thirst strike, I had to make a run for the alley. Not as though people were after me, but the elements. The foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need; at the bottom of any body-based need is grace. When I appeared at the opening of the alley, a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall. Women who work against surfaces inspire me to do thingsI thought about telling her, orshort women make me want things. All the time while I was growing up I put a lot of demands on my juice; forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it. I did not forget it, but was embroiled. The newspapers were saying things about the past. People were celebrating thick juice, and I kept writing those poems. That day in the alley I realized three things about life. While assisting her I learned three things to carry around with me, to disperse when needed. For six months during the crisis, I did not care about the crisis. When my faith returned all my lovers were gone. That morning I woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis; I was beneath my bed. It was the sixth day that I had awakened beneath my bed. I was lonely, but I was also sure. Life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character, whowhen we passed on the streetdid not know me. I knew it was me by the way my head felt: people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it. Today all my ideas are liquid. That day of my faith, friends thinking I was sick came by to see me. It would be the last day I spent alone; I was happy, but still would not drink. The juice on my mind was no longer juice. There was an absence there, but one so constant it became familiar. I did not want to drink it.", "label": "human"}
{"text": "Six Songs of Love, Constancy, Romance, Inconstancy, Truth, and Marriage Oh! yet one smile, tho' dark may lower Around thee clouds of woe and ill, Let me yet feel that I have power, Mid Fate's bleak storms, to soothe thee still. Tho' sadness be upon thy brow, Yet let it turn, dear love, to me, I cannot bear that thou should'st know Sorrow I do not share with thee. True love's wreath is of mountain flowers, They stand the storm and brave the blast, And blossom on, so love like ours Is sweetest when all else is past. Too well I know what storms have frowned, And now frown on life's troubled tide; Still darker let them gather round, They have no power on hearts so tried. Then say not that you may not bear, To shadow spirit light as mine; I shall not shrink, or fear to share The darkest fate if it be thine! Oh! say not love was never made For heart so light as mine; Must love then seek the cypress shade, Rear but a gloomy shrine. Oh! say not, that for me more meet The revelry of youth; Or that my wild heart cannot beat With deep devoted truth. Tho' mirth may many changes ring, 'Tis but an outward show, Even upon the fond dove's wing Will varying colours glow. Light smiles upon my lip may gleam And sparkle o'er my brow, 'Tis but the glisten of the stream That hides the gold below. 'Tis love that gilds the mirthful hour, That lights the smile for me, Those smiles would instant lose their power, Did they not glance on thee! Oh! come to my slumber Sweet dreams of my love, I have hung the charmed wreath My soft pillow above. The roses are linked In a chain pure and white; And the rose-leaves are wet With the dew drops of night. The moon was on high As I gather'd each flower; The dew that then falls Has a magical power. The Spirit of slumber Those roses has blest; And sweet are the visions They'll bring to my rest. Be their spell on my soul, So they let me but see His dark eyes flash in love And his smile glance on me. Let sleep bring the image Of him far away; 'Tis worth all the tears I shed for him by day. I have hung the charmed wreath My soft pillow above; Then come to my slumber, Sweet dreams of my love! How vain to cast my love away On bosom false as thine; The floweret's bloom, that springs in May, Would be a safer shrine To build my fondest hopes upon, Tho' fragile it may be. That flower's smile is not sooner gone Than love that trusts to thee. Love asks a calm, a gentle home, Or else its life is o'er; If once you let its pinions roam, Oh! then 'tis love no more. The aspin's changefuI shade can be No shelter for the dove; And hearts as varying as that tree, Are sure no place for love. Hope linger'd long and anxiously, O'er failing faith, but now I give thee back each heartless sigh, Give back each broken vow. I'll trust the stay of tulip dyes, The calm of yon wild sea, The sunshine of the April skies, But never more to thee! Oh! would that love had power to raise A little isle for us alone, With fairy flowers, and sunny rays, The blue sea wave its guardian zone. No other step should ever press This hidden Eden of the heart, And we would share its loveliness, From every other thing apart. The rose and violet should weep, Whene'er our leafy couch was laid, The lark should wake our morning sleep, The bulbul sing our serenade. And we would watch the starry hours, And call the moon to hear our vows, And we would cull the sweetest flowers, And twine fresh chaplets for our brows. I thought thus of the flowers, the moon, This fairy isle for you and me; And then I thought how very soon How very tired we should be. Matrimonial Creed.HE must be rich whom I could love, His fortune clear must be, Whether in land or in the funds, 'Tis all the same to me. He must be old whom I could love, Then he'll not plague me long; In sooth 'twill he a pleasant sight,To see him borne along To where the croaking ravens lurk, And where the earth worms dwell: A widow's hood will suit my face,And black becomes me well. And he must make a settlement, I'll have no man without; And when he writes his testament, He must not leave me out. Oh! such a man as this would suit Each wish I here express; If he should say, Will you have me? I'll very soon say Yes!", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Heredities (1) Etymology When she was seven, my grandmother suffered from fever and swollen glands. The doctors believed her tonsils were inflamed, that she needed surgery. Instead, she went to a curandera. The curandera divined that a jealous relative had cast a curse on her and, now, her language of kindness was bound to her throat, the unspoken swelling her glands.As a child my grandmother spoke to santitos with a voice like a chestnut: ruddy and warm, seeds dropping from her mouth. The santitos would take her words into themselves, her voice growing within them like grapevines.During the tonsillitis, when the words no longer fell like seeds from her lips, the santito's vineyards of accent and voice grew vapid, dry as a parched mouth. They went to her tongue and asked why silence imprisoned the words of the child, why lumps were present under her chin, why tears drew channels down her cheeks.I asked my grandmother how her tongue replied. After touching my cheek, she told me she had a dream that night: She was within her lungs and she rose like breath through the moist of her throat. She remembered her tonsils swinging before her like fleshy apples, then a hand taking them into a fist, harvesting their sound. She told me her throat opened in two spots like insect eyes and the names of her children came flying through her wounds like peacocks.Patting my thigh, she said, \"That is why the name of your mother is Maria, because she is a prayer, a song of praise to the Holy Mother.\" She told me this, then showed me two scars on her throattiny scars, like two eyelids stitched closed.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "The Imperfect Enjoyment Naked she lay, clasped in my longing arms, I filled with love, and she all over charms; Both equally inspired with eager fire, Melting through kindness, flaming in desire. With arms, legs, lips close clinging to embrace, She clips me to her breast, and sucks me to her face. Her nimble tongue, loves lesser lightning, played Within my mouth, and to my thoughts conveyed Swift orders that I should prepare to throw The all-dissolving thunderbolt below. My fluttering soul, sprung with the pointed kiss, Hangs hovering oer her balmy brinks of bliss. But whilst her busy hand would guide that part Which should convey my soul up to her heart, In liquid raptures I dissolve all oer, Melt into sperm, and spend at every pore. A touch from any part of her had done t: Her hand, her foot, her very look's a cunt. Smiling, she chides in a kind murmuring noise, And from her body wipes the clammy joys, When, with a thousand kisses wandering oer My panting bosom, Is there then no more? She cries. All this to love and raptures due; Must we not pay a debt to pleasure too? But I, the most forlorn, lost man alive, To show my wished obedience vainly strive: I sigh, alas! and kiss, but cannot swive. Eager desires confound my first intent, Succeeding shame does more success prevent, And rage at last confirms me impotent. Evn her fair hand, which might bid heat return To frozen age, and make cold hermits burn, Applied to my dear cinder, warms no more Than fire to ashes could past flames restore. Trembling, confused, despairing, limber, dry, A wishing, weak, unmoving lump I lie. This dart of love, whose piercing point, oft tried, With virgin blood ten thousand maids has dyed, Which nature still directed with such art That it through every cunt reached every heart Stiffly resolved, twould carelessly invade Woman or man, nor ought its fury stayed: Whereer it pierced, a cunt it found or made Now languid lies in this unhappy hour, Shrunk up and sapless like a withered flower. Thou treacherous, base deserter of my flame, False to my passion, fatal to my fame, Through what mistaken magic dost thou prove So true to lewdness, so untrue to love? What oyster-cinder-beggar-common whore Didst thou eer fail in all thy life before? When vice, disease, and scandal lead the way, With what officious haste doest thou obey! Like a rude, roaring hector in the streets Who scuffles, cuffs, and justles all he meets, But if his king or country claim his aid, The rakehell villain shrinks and hides his head; Evn so thy brutal valor is displayed, Breaks every stew, does each small whore invade, But when great Love the onset does command, Base recreant to thy prince, thou darst not stand. Worst part of me, and henceforth hated most, Through all the town a common fucking post, On whom each whore relieves her tingling cunt As hogs on gates do rub themselves and grunt, Mayst thou to ravenous chancres be a prey, Or in consuming weepings waste away; May strangury and stone thy days attend; Mayst thou never piss, who didst refuse to spend When all my joys did on false thee depend.

Its nearly freezing out.Meanwhile I was thinking about howKolya is a rude artist.In the sense thatThere are radical artistsEverywhere you look,But not so manyGenuinely rude artists.The rudeness of an artist,I thought,Is an interesting quality.But now Channel One is leaving,Kolya takes off his jacket with its skullsAnd sets up our cameras.We are the representatives of the left, we say.Lanzmann lowers his gaze wearily:Now theyre going to start in about Israel.But Kolya, having explained a bitAbout his art collective,Asks Lanzmann insteadAbout monumentalArt:MonumentalArt. What might it look likeRight now?How should I know?Says Lanzmann.There could be noMonumentalArtToday.The world is scattered. ForA monumentalWork you needA unified senseOf the world.But you yourselfFilmed a monumentalWork. Surely you haveSome ideas on this score?I didnt think aboutThat. Im an artist,Understand? I dontThink in suchCategories. What are you,Communists?Your task isThe Revolution.Why are you askingMe aboutMonumentalArt?Were the ones asking the questionsWere the ones asking the questionsWe here are the ones asking the questions.In the iron airOf Moscow.Edelman, Markelov,Pechersky are with us.Medvedev the Bear Jew and JeffThe Snowman Monson Thats what they call usAround town.In what capacityDid you make that film As a Frenchman, a Jew,An intellectual?Or as a memberOf the Resistance?I repeat,I wanted ... Does the termThe Holocaust IndustryMean anything to you?Whats that?Asks Lanzmann.(I warned KolyaThat Lanzmann wouldntUnderstandOr would pretendNot to understandWhat that means.)The Holocaust IndustryUsually meansThe use of the memoryOf the destruction of the JewsDuring World War IITo legitimate, in part,The State of Israel.The translator startsTo worry.She suspects usOf anti-Semitism.But we are like LanzmannWho came to MoscowTo do this strange interview,Without revealing his secrets.He wont talk,Hes hard as a rock,This man whose youthIs reflectedIn our cockyFaces.Lanzmann himself has conductedMany interviews:With Franz Suchomel,The SS Unterscharfuhrer,With Jan Karski,And others.He knows very wellHow to walkHis subjectsInto this or thatConfessionOr experience,All while leveragingHis moral authority.And here, gradually,In the words of this masterOf the interview,We begin to detectThe artistic positionWhich we so oppose.I, you know, justSlapped together thisThing.I was interestedIn the human aspect.As for ideasAnd theoriesThats not my bag. Of course, many artistsTake this stand.They dont interest us at all.But Lanzmann, on the one hand,Enjoys this statusAs an artist who works withEmotions, memories,His own and other peoplesExperiences, that is, more withEmotions than with documents.On the other hand, he knewFull well that his filmWould be receivedAs a political proclamation,That it would quickly occupy the heartOf intellectual and socio-Political debates.To work on peoples feelings,As an artist, while at the same timeRefusing to engage in rationalExplanations, of the sortDemanded of intellectuals reallyThis is the same stuff as using theIncomprehensibility of HitlerOr the destruction of the JewsAs a form of political argument And this is the shamefulHypocrisy of our friend Lanzmann.How to save himselfFrom this disgraceThe old man LanzmannDoes not know.But we know, and well tell:You need to speak about IsraelYou need to speak about IsraelIn this is the key to immortalityThis is the burning woundAnd it is Lanzmann who understands thisHe knows that politics is the woundOn the body of history.An unnecessary, unwanted woundThat will not heal.To refuse to forget politicsTo refuse to tear IsraelFrom ones heart Because politics isAlways here,And Palestine is a bloody wound that says:Politics isAlways here.You cant hide from itAt the supermarket,You cant run from itWith beautiful words.And old man LanzmannUnderstands this,He knows thatPolitics is the woundOn the body of history.In its inability to process its ownInformation,A rejection of politicsLeads to senility.(Only later would I findThis passageIn an interview Lanzmann gaveTo Der Spiegel:Spiegel: You writeThat the Israeli military doctorWho gave you a check-upBefore you flew in a fighter planeSaid you could liveUntil a hundred and twenty.Are you worried aboutDeath right now,At your age?Lanzmann: I have no age.I constantly thinkOf death, includingMy own.At the same timeThis remains totallyUnreal. As I saidEarlier, only lifeHas any meaning.) Does the termThe Holocaust IndustryMean anything to you?I dont wantTo talkAbout Israel.I repeat:You are thinkingIn abstractCategories.Yes, but your filmBecame the centerOf intellectualDebate About the uniquenessOf the Holocaust,About the supposedAnti-SemitismOf the Poles. ManyThought that your movieMade the Poles outTo beAnti-Semites.Israel existsUnder impossiblePressure.Its army must be judgedAccording to different measures.The Israeli Merkava tankWas createdIn impossible conditions.Israeli tank officersLove their Merkavas,They are obligedTo have them alwaysAt the ready.And you, instead ofBuilding upAbstractTheories,Should try harderTo create artistic works ... An artist has his ownWay of seeing.And so on.The director is tired.Its time for a rest.Communists? I know your path.First, revolution; then firing squads.A warning from the attache Our timeIs almost up.This will beOur last questionAnd our judgment of the grayOld manWill be simple.He has just one moment leftTo die young.But what did the fog of those eyesCommunicate?Vague sentence fragments,A dry, unpleasant refusal?

{"text": "The Secretary of Liquor (JOHN F. KENNEDYS INFORMAL APPOINTMENT OF DEAN MARTIN TO HIS CABINET) What the fuck did they want, these men who needed the company of others to make a life, as he needed a woman to make babies? Dino, nick tosches I always plays to de common folk. dean martin 1It was casting time for The Young Lions.Brando wouldnt hesitate given this chance to dyehis hair white and do a Germanaccent. And while no one would hire Monty Cliftafter his facially disfiguring car-wreck,Brando convinced the studio that the other, slightlyolder, kid from Omaha was the right man.No one could play a more sensitive-tough than Monty,like the artist-bugler-boxer Prewittmistaken for the enemy, gunned downby his own men in the Pearl Harbor dawn;or the way, as the seraphic cowboy Matt Dunson,he got a rise out of his demented empire builderfather, John Wayne, by kicking over a tin cup,sloshing the coffee into the dust to show his disgust.Clift knew that Lions director Edward Dmytrykwas searching for someone to play a keysupporting roleas Frank Sinatra had in From Here ToEternityyet he was stunned to hear it wasJerry Lewiss partner in shlock.Clift softened, nauseated when he sawMartins competitionpander to the crowd on Broadway.Lucky for Monty that he let it go: the two mennot only became friends; it was Deanwho put the man with the wired-jaw to bedwhen he had the chloral hydrate and alcohol wobblies.Ignorant of Brandos intervention on his behalf,Monty told Dean that Marlons fifty takes per scenewere getting on his nerves more and moreand he vowed to walk off the set if he triedONE MORE TIME to have his German soldier diewith arms spread wide to echo the crucifixion.Clift, wasted with self-recrimination at forty-five.Martin, an actor for whom one run through a scenealmost always sufficed.Dean got a chuckle out of Monty with his response.It should be awful good with so many takes.Then the future flashed before him.I guess there are directors who want us to dothe same scene over and over again too.Sure, lots. Some of the best.I guess I got spoiled. Jerry and I gotto where we pretty much called the shots.And thenwithout any foreknowledgethat hed be doing his only two otherserious roles in the next two yearsand be subject to directorial rule on the sets ofSome Came Running and Rio Bravohe vowed in the future to set up his golf netbefore shooting started on a picture.Dean appeared to float, perfectionnever an aspiration: that he was already as well knownfor his insouciance and drunk persona as forhis singing and acting doesnt mean he was so well-defendedthat he didnt feel any pressure about workingwith such aces as Brando and Clift.He didnt have to stretch to play a would-be draft dodger,Michael Whiteacre: a likeable coward like myself,a screenwriter in Shaws novel, a singer in the movie.The army doctor feeds Dean his first line in Lionsas if his future were visible in the instant:art and life exquisitely commingled.Doctor: For a man your age and in your professionyoure in excellent health. How do you manage it?Martin doesnt hesitate: Clean liquor.But sauntering through this role didnt meaneverything was swell: he felt so out-of-placeon location in France he gave up the offer ofa choice part in The Guns of Navaronebecause it meant going back to Europe.In his middle years, he ambled through the roleof Matt Helm in another tonelessBondian takeoff, and when Columbiawanted to shoot Murderers Rowon location in Cannes, Dinoset the studio straight: fuck no,just build some fake Riviera sets. 2A diffident crooner, he needed a stooge.License to fuck around on stage.After his split with Jerry, Dinos drunk persona grewinto a ghostly partner, and by the time he had his own TV showthe public was so saturated with his presence,many conflated the persona and the person.When he landed the drunks key role in Rio Bravo,he turned to Brando for help, what should I do?Brando told him what to think about.The more inscrutable the subjectthe more this spectre stands out in relief.Part of Martins appeal was that no one knew him.It wasnt a mask; his detachment was who he was.He showed up, his spirit remained elsewhere.His wives and children found him unknowable.It wasnt personal. When the Martins entertained,the guests carried on while Dino disappearedinto his room to watch westerns on TV, alone.It wasnt personal. When the producer ofThe Colgate Comedy Hour suggested they have lunchto get to know one another, Dinoset him straight: No one gets to know me.Martin was a man no one came close to knowing.What does it mean, to know someone? 3Why ask such questions at all after Socratesbeguiled us out of answers and set us onthe inexhaustible path...dialectics?Dont you think I havent wondered if I haventstrayed from my true path as I find myselftracking the trajectory of such non-exemplary lives?Youre thinking its a trick, and will not answer,but before you judge my dissolute subjectwho like the money but thought all the attentionwas a joke because a singer is nothingas a derelict choice, consider how philosophy,while striving to become more concretecontinues to recoil before the problem of other minds.And it is said that Monsieur Sartre turned palerthan his martini, when Raymond Aronchallenged the Husserlians, at the Bec de Gazin Montparnasse, to make philosophyout of a cocktail glass. 4Theres something about everyone no one can know.There was no question of Dino taking ordersand being bossed around was out of bounds:penalty shot incurred for the perpetrator,who was, this time, the imperious Billy Wilderwhose streak of hits was breaking fast.Dino as always was doing his job,which was to literally play himself in Kiss Me,Stupid", "label": "human"}

{"text": "the children of immigrants When I am a toddler, a child, a tween, a teen, and a young adult, I am called an ancestral soul, a ti gran moun, a little old person. Adults study me and decide that I am wise beyond my years, mature for my age, emotionally ripe. I am told it is unusual to meet a five-ten-fifteen-year-old girl who does not slouch or mumble or speak in monosyllables. When I do the things that come naturally to mewhen I hold my spine up erect, when I wait my turn to speak, when I speak having listened, carefully, when I enunciate, when I look grown-ups in the eyeI am told I must have been here before. \"How do you know?\" one college professor asks me after she has seen a psychologically violent play I have written at age nineteen. \"How do you already know? In high school, I charm my teachers. They encourage me to write speeches about feminism that I recite for International Women's Day at City Hall or deliver as part of conference panels at local universities. If you were older,\" they tell me, \"we would probably be friends. One of them even flirts with me. Among my peers I exist somewhere between amicably mysterious and irrevocably dorky. The popular kids greet me in the hallways, but they never invite me to their beer-drenched parties. I will never play Spin the Bottle. I will never play Seven Minutes in Heaven. My mother tells me she is protecting me from boys, but the truth is, after I do my homework, she wants me to type up another family friends resume or resignation letter. At home, I am a bridge, a cultural interpreter, a spokesperson, a trusted ally, an American who is Haitian too, but also definitely American. The children of immigrants don't get to be children. We lose our innocence watching our parents' backs bend, break. I am an old soul because when I am young, I watch my parents' spirits get slaughtered. In Haiti, they were middle class. Hopeful teachers. Home owners. They were black like their live-in servants. They donated clothes to the poor. They gave up everything they knew to inherit American dreams. And here, they join factory lines, wipe shit from mean old white men's behinds, scrub five-star hotel toilets for dimes above minimum wage. Here, they shuck and jive and step and fetch and play chauffeur to people who aren't as smart as they are, people who do not speak as many languages as they do. In the 1980s, they are barred from giving blood because newscasters and politicians say that AIDS comes from where they come from: Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, a black magic island that spawns boat people and chaos, a place of illiterate zombies, orphan beggars and brazen political corruption. When I am a child, my childhood is a luxury my family cannot afford. Their dignity is not spared, so my innocence is not spared. They are humiliated and traumatized daily, so I become a nurse to their trauma. I am told too much, so I know too much, so I am wise beyond my years. When I am six, my mother tells me that when she found out she was pregnant with me at age nineteen, she tried to kill the baby.\" She says \"the baby,\" as if it isnt me shes talking about; as if I am not the expensive, scandalous daughter who forced my way into her world despite the abortion-inducing herbal teas she drank and her frantic leaps off of small buildings. When I am sixteen, my father calls me on the phone to, inevitably, weep. He says, \"Living in this country, I have learned not to hope for things. Only you are my hope. Only you.\"Soyes, I grow up fast.", "label": "human"}

Though he knew them all, hed be sotaken with her that hed lose what she was saying,hed undergo the list and ask if shed behiring a car. Shed pick one up tomorrow inHammersmith and then drive west. Would she havedinner with him tonight? Shed say shed like that:she was booked at the St. Margarets, off Russell Square,could he meet her there at seven? When shed close her eyes,her head against the cushioned wing of the seat,hed think her managing to rest was not so much acarelessness to his attentions as that she wasnt vain.She wouldnt catch him watching if he angled his lookaway from her toward the window, in the tunnelsespecially hed see reflected in its glass her gradualfull outline as she breathed.

The new mayflies cantlift themselves from the surface film until theirwings dry. When I watch them drift down over the slack water,disturbances are rocks sometimes and sometimes fish.Linda does needlepoint and crossword puzzles. She keepschecklists of the flowers she finds on her long woodland walks.We do our wash in town and play cards in the hotel lobby.We have time to read. By August, there are berries.A six-pack of Grain Belt beer is ninety-nine cents.Friends have a ranch with acres that stretch back throughbottomland to their mountain pasture. The oldHodges place is vacant. They ask us to stay.In the upstairs bedroom under the cottonwood,its almost dark when it clouds up late in the afternoon.We find cancelled checks in the homestead down by the creek.Lots are for sale. In our fifth summer there, we buy one.A contractor frames a house for us which I havesix weeks to enclose.

But though she has toleave sometimes and not come back for hours, the work gets done.We drain the pipes, hang shutters, close the place up.[...] After five years of saying it, it became ajoke with us that wed have a baby in five years.Were waiting for the EPT. Sitting as faraway from it as she can and still be home, she wantsme to be the one to read it. Im surprised howglad I am. Her not being glad lasts half an hour.Shell work for the library until shes due in June.The baby does its tours inside her. When we put the bigheadphones on her tummy, it seems to hear.Her doctor tells her to cut down on salt, herblood pressures high. We buy a stethoscope and cuff.She tells Linda to quit her job and go to bed.The salt-free cottage cheese is cardboard, but itsnot working, nothing is, I can wait until shes beenresting for an hour before I take it, it doesnt help.Since her diastolic numbers always high, its ofcourse high when she sees the doctor: shell be in thehospital tomorrow morning if we dont changedoctors tonight. La Leche League has two it recommends.The one who calls back asks everything. If she werehis wife, he says, hed want her in the hospital.Were too frightened to sleep. I hold her. I fall offonly when its almost light and by then thebirds have started. It makes her cry to hear them.When shes admitted to the ward, they hook anIV up to her that hurts her hand. On the vacant bednext to her, theres a tray with a syringe and drugs:if she goes into labor she might have convulsions.They tell us on Monday that the baby wouldnt be able tobreathe yet on its own, on Wednesday that it couldsuffocate inside her, her placentas shutting down.Theyll do another amniocentesis in the morning,theyll take the baby in the afternoon. She and I are suchcases by now that I think theyll lie, theyll want toquiet us for the birth by telling us the babys lungsare ready, that stranger things have happened in three days.A nurse comes in and says the babys lungs are ready,lets go to prep. Since Linda cant have itnaturally, it matters all the more to her that she atleast be awake. Shell get to be. Both doctorspromised me this morning that shell have a local,its up to them. I get scrubbed. Everyones in greens.Down a corridor, away from me so I wont hear,the anesthesiologist is talking to her doctors,who are very intent. The scene breaks up. Her doctorsdont have to tell me, I know already, I want tohit them, I say Id promised her because theyd promised,Id told her she could be awake, that I couldbe there with her. Stop it, you cant let hersee you like this, her pediatrician says.Shes partly sedated. I tell her Ill be waitingright down the hall. From another room than hers, ababy, a first cry. I have to hear it or not listen too forour baby, Lindas asleep, she cant. If its fromher room now that Im hearing something fainter,someone should tell me soon. I believe the nurse who says I cant tell you what it is, but its really good. How is Linda? Theyre sewing her up now, shell be fine.Theres no reason not to believe her, Lindasnot going to die, shes not going to die or have tohate it that she didnt, her babys all right, we haventkilled it by not changing doctors. It wont have to bebreathed for by a machine. Almost a month early, hes awonder to the staff at five pounds ten, hes Lindas doing,she should be proud of him, shell nurse him and shell heal.I can buy her now the blue- and white-checked ginghammother and baby rabbit. I can buy her a robe. He comeshome with her after the weekend. The two of them feel sohallowed to me that Im slow to tell it hasnt workedout for her at all. She writes an essay about it.His having been taken from her early means she failed.Bodies are bodies. They know things, they have their own ways.She could have done it if shed gotten the chance. Her doctordidnt want Linda caring how things went. That had to beher job, not Lindas. Shed gone on to say it almostproudly of Linda at the last: This little girl would be fine if she didnt have a brain.Its a long essay. I recognize everything but me.Not her antagonist, exactly, Id been anotherthing shed had to worry. Whenever Id taken herblood pressure, shed felt blamed by me if it was high.Each crisis had been hers to deal with by herself.Too busy or aloof to find her a better doctor,Id taught my classes, read, worked on my poem.[...] Shes at the mirror.I need to get behind it to the aspirin,do so, close it. Goodness you wake up with a lot of headaches. Sorry. Dont be sorry, Im sorry for you.Surprised that it turned out like that, andhating her, hating what Id heard in my own voice,I get out of her way. From the privacy ofbrooding on it in another room, I hear what she meant:Congratulations. As good as you are at headaches,why settle for so little, why not work up amalignancy of some kind? And I remember thatyesterday, when we were getting in the car, she winced.Shes always twisting her neck or back or something,so I didnt ask her Did you hurt yourself? but Did you hurt yourself again?[...] I move the rest of my clothes out of the house.Our fights about money pass. In having toleave her, I also have to think again the mostforgettable of our outings. Over the years, wed taken ourbodies along in company to certain places. Infront of me a little to the left, shed answered Yes toTwo for dinner? I wasnt thinking, at the time, how Ifit into what she cared about: she fit for me. It comesback to me now because I have to change it, Idgotten it wrong.

{"text": "Morte d'Arthur So all day long the noise of battle roll'd Among the mountains by the winter sea; Until King Arthur's table, man by man, Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their Lord, King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep, The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him, Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights, And bore him to a chapel nigh the field, A broken chancel with a broken cross, That stood on a dark strait of barren land. On one side lay the ocean, and on one Lay a great water, and the moon was full. Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: \"The sequel of to-day unsolders all The goodliest fellowship of famous knights Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep They sleepthe men I loved. I think that we Shall never more, at any future time, Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds, Walking about the gardens and the halls Of Camelot, as in the days that were. I perish by this people which I made, Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again To rule once morebut let what will be, be, I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm That without help I cannot last till morn. Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur, Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how In those old days, one summer noon, an arm Rose up from out the bosom of the lake, Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, Holding the swordand how I row'd across And took it, and have worn it, like a king: And, wheresoever I am sung or told In aftertime, this also shall be known: But now delay not: take Excalibur, And fling him far into the middle mere: Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word.\" To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere: \"It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus, Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm. A little thing may harm a wounded man. Yet I thy hest will all perform at full, Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.\" So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept And in the moon athwart the place of tombs, Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock, Came on the shining levels of the lake. There drew he forth the brand Excalibur, And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood, This way and that dividing the swift mind, In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd There in the many-knotted water-flags, That whistled stiff and dry about the marge. So strode he back slow to the wounded King. Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: \"Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave? What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?\" And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: \"I heard the ripple washing in the reeds, And the wild water lapping on the crag.\" To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale: \"Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight: For surer sign had follow'd, either hand, Or voice, or else a motion of the mere. This is a shameful thing for men to lie. Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.\" Then went Sir Bedivere the second time Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought; But when he saw the wonder of the hilt, How curiously and strangely chased, he smote His palms together, and he cried aloud, \"And if indeed I cast the brand away, Surely a precious thing, one worthy note, Should thus be lost forever from the earth, Which might have pleased the eyes of many men. What good should follow this, if this were done? What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey, Seeing obedience is the bond of rule. Were it well to obey then, if a king demand An act unprofitable, against himself? The King is sick, and knows not what he does. What record, or what relic of my lord Should be to aftertime, but empty breath And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, Some one might show it at a joust of arms, Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake; Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps Upon the hidden bases of the hills.' So might some old man speak in the aftertime To all the people, winning reverence. But now much honour and much fame were lost.\" So spake he, clouded with his own conceit, And hid Excalibur the second time, And so strode back slow to the wounded King. Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily: \"What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?\" And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: \"I heard the water lapping on the crag, And the long ripple washing in the reeds.\" To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath: \"Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me! Authority forgets a dying king, Laid widow'd of the power in his eye That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art, For thou, the latest-left of all my knights, In whom should meet the offices of all, Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; Either from lust of gold, or like a girl Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, And the third time may prosper, get thee hence: But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur, I will arise and slay thee with my hands.\" Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword, And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, Shot like a streamer of the northern morn, Seen where the moving isles of winter shock By night, with noises of the northern sea. So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur: But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him Three times, and drew him under in the mere. And lightly went the other to the King. Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath: \"Now see I by thine eyes that this is done. Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?\" And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: \"Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems Should blind my purpose, for I never saw, Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die, Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men, So great a miracle as yonder hilt. Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him; But when I look'd again, behold an arm, Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him Three times, and drew him under in the mere.\" And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard: \"My end draws nigh; 't is time that I were gone. Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, And bear me to the margin; yet I fear My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.\" So saying, from the pavement he half rose, Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, And would have spoken, but he found not words, Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs. But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard, Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King Muttering and murmuring at his ear, \"Quick, quick! I fear it is too late, and I shall die.\" But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd Larger than human on the frozen hills. He heard the deep behind him, and a cry Before. His own thought drove him like a goad. Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves And barren chasms, and all to left and right The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels And on a sudden, lo! the level lake, And the long glories of the winter moon. Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, Beneath them; and descending they were ware That all the decks were dense with stately forms Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dreamby these Three Queens with crowns of goldand from them rose A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, And, as it were one voice, an agony Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills All night in a waste land, where no one comes, Or hath come, since the making of the world. Then murmur'd Arthur, \"Place me in the barge,\" And to the barge they came. There those three Queens Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept. But she that rose the tallest of them all And fairest, laid his head upon her lap, And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, And call'd him by his name, complaining loud And dropping bitter tears against his brow Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white And colourless, and like the wither'd moon Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls That made his forehead like a rising sun High from the dais-thronewere parch'd with dust; Or, clotted into points and hanging loose, Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. So like a shatter'd column lay the King; Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest, From spur to plume a star of tournament, Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged Before the eyes of ladies and of kings. Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere: \"Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go? Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes? For now I see the true old times are dead, When every morning brought a noble chance, And every chance brought out a noble knight. Such times have been not since the light that led The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh. But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved Which was an image of the mighty world; And I, the last, go forth companionless, And the days darken round me, and the years, Among new men, strange faces, other minds.\" And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge: \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new, And God fulfils Himself in many ways, Lest one good custom should corrupt the world. Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? I have lived my life, and that which I have done May He within Himself make pure! but thou, If thou shouldst never see my face again, Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice Rise like a fountain for me night and day. For what are men better than sheep or goats That nourish a blind life within the brain, If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer Both for themselves and those who call them friend? For so the whole round earth is every way Bound by gold chains about the feet of God. But now farewell. I am going a long way With these thou seestif indeed I go (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt) To the island-valley of Avilion; Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.\" So said he, and the barge with oar and sail Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan That, fluting a wild carol ere her death, Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere Revolving many memories, till the hull Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn, And on the mere the wailing died away.", "label": "human"}

{"text": "Mac Flecknoe A Satire upon the True-blue Protestant Poet T.S.All human things are subject to decay,And, when Fate summons, monarchs must obey:This Flecknoe found, who, like Augustus, youngWas call'd to empire, and had govern'd long:In prose and verse, was own'd, without disputeThrough all the realms of Non-sense, absolute.This aged prince now flourishing in peace,And blest with issue of a large increase,Worn out with business, did at length debateTo settle the succession of the State:And pond'ring which of all his sons was fitTo reign, and wage immortal war with wit;Cry'd, 'tis resolv'd; for nature pleads that heShould only rule, who most resembles me:Shadwell alone my perfect image bears,Mature in dullness from his tender years.Shadwell alone, of all my sons, is heWho stands confirm'd in full stupidity.The rest to some faint meaning make pretence,But Shadwell never deviates into sense.Some beams of wit on other souls may fall,Strike through and make a lucid interval;But Shadwell's genuine night admits no ray,His rising fogs prevail upon the day:Besides his goodly fabric fills the eye,And seems design'd for thoughtless majesty:Thoughtless as monarch oaks, that shade the plain,And, spread in solemn state, supinely reign.Heywood and Shirley were but types of thee,Thou last great prophet of tautology:Even I, a dunce of more renown than they,Was sent before but to prepare thy way;And coarsely clad in Norwich drugget cameTo teach the nations in thy greater name.My warbling lute, the lute I whilom strungWhen to King John of Portugal I sung,Was but the prelude to that glorious day,When thou on silver Thames did'st cut thy way,With well tim'd oars before the royal barge,Swell'd with the pride of thy celestial charge;And big with hymn, commander of an host,The like was ne'er in Epsom blankets toss'd.Methinks I see the new Arion sail,The lute still trembling underneath thy nail.At thy well sharpen'd thumb from shore to shoreThe treble squeaks for fear, the basses roar:Echoes from Pissing-Alley, Shadwell call,And Shadwell they resound from Aston Hall.About thy boat the little fishes throng,As at the morning toast, that floats along.Sometimes as prince of thy harmonious bandThou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand.St. Andre's feet ne'er kept more equal time,Not ev'n the feet of thy own Psyche's rhyme:Though they in number as in sense excel;So just, so like tautology they fell,That, pale with envy, Singleton forsworeThe lute and sword which he in triumph boreAnd vow'd he ne'er would act Villerius more.Here stopt the good old sire; and wept for joyIn silent raptures of the hopeful boy.All arguments, but most his plays, persuade,That for anointed dullness he was made. Close to the walls which fair Augusta bind,(The fair Augusta much to fears inclin'd)An ancient fabric, rais'd t'inform the sight,There stood of yore, and Barbican it hight:A watch tower once; but now, so fate ordains,Of all the pile an empty name remains.From its old ruins brothel-houses rise,Scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys.Where their vast courts, the mother-strumpets keep,And, undisturb'd by watch, in silence sleep.Near these a nursery erects its head,Where queens are form'd, and future heroes bred;Where unfledg'd actors learn to laugh and cry,Where infant punks their tender voices try,And little Maximins the gods defy.Great Fletcher never treads in buskins here,Nor greater Jonson dares in socks appear;But gentle Simkin just reception findsAmidst this monument of vanish'd minds:Pure clinches, the suburbian muse affords;And Panton waging harmless war with words.Here Flecknoe, as a place to fame well known,Ambitiously design'd his Shadwell's throne.For ancient Decker prophesi'd long since,That in this pile should reign a mighty prince,Born for a scourge of wit, and flail of sense:To whom true dullness should some Psyches owe,But worlds of Misers from his pen should flow;Humorists and hypocrites it should produce,Whole Raymond families, and tribes of Bruce. Now Empress Fame had publisht the renown,Of Shadwell's coronation through the town.Rous'd by report of fame, the nations meet,From near Bun-Hill, and distant Watling-street.No Persian carpets spread th'imperial way,But scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay:From dusty shops neglected authors come,Martyrs of pies, and reliques of the bum.Much Heywood, Shirley, Ogleby there lay,But loads of Shadwell almost chok'd the way.Bilk'd stationers for yeoman stood prepar'd,And Herringman was Captain of the Guard.The hoary prince in majesty appear'd,High on a throne of his own labours rear'd.At his right hand our young Ascanius satRome's other hope, and pillar of the state.His brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace,And lambent dullness play'd around his face.As Hannibal did to the altars come,Sworn by his sire a mortal foe to Rome;So Shadwell swore, nor should his vow be vain,That he till death true dullness would maintain;And in his father's right, and realm's defence,Ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense.The king himself the sacred unction made,As king by office, and as priest by trade:In his sinister hand, instead of ball,He plac'd a mighty mug of potent ale;Love's kingdom to his right he did convey,At once his sceptre and his rule of sway;Whose righteous lore the prince had practis'd young,And from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung,His temples last with poppies were o'er spread,That nodding seem'd to consecrate his head:Just at that point of time, if fame not lie,On his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly.So Romulus, 'tis sung, by Tiber's brook,Presage of sway from twice six vultures took.Th'admiring throng loud acclamations make,And omens of his future empire take.The sire then shook the honours of his head,And from his brows damps of oblivion shedFull on the filial dullness: long he stood,Repelling from his breast the raging god;At length burst out in this prophetic mood: Heavens bless my son, from Ireland let him reignTo far Barbadoes on the Western main;Of his dominion may no end be known,And greater than his father's be his throne.Beyond love's kingdom let him stretch his pen;He paus'd, and all the people cry'd Amen.Then thus, continu'd he, my son advanceStill in new impudence, new ignorance.Success let other teach, learn thou from mePangs without birth, and fruitless industry.Let Virtuosos in five years be writ;Yet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit.Let gentle George in triumph tread the stage,Make Dorimant betray, and Loveit rage;Let Cully, Cockwood, Fopling, charm the pit,And in their folly show the writer's wit.Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence,And justify their author's want of sense.Let 'em be all by thy own model madeOf dullness, and desire no foreign aid:That they to future ages may be known,Not copies drawn, but issue of thy own.Nay let thy men of wit too be the same,All full of thee, and differing but in name;But let no alien Sedley interposeTo lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose.And when false flowers of rhetoric thou would'st cull,Trust Nature, do not labour to be dull;But write thy best, and top; and in each line,Sir Formal's oratory will be thine.Sir Formal, though unsought, attends thy quill,And does thy Northern Dedications fill.Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame,By arrogating Jonson's hostile name.Let Father Flecknoe fire thy mind with praise,And Uncle Ogleby thy envy raise.Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no part;What share have we in Nature or in Art?Where did his wit on learning fix a brand,And rail at arts he did not understand?Where made he love in Prince Nicander's vein,Or swept the dust in Psyche's humble strain?Where sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my arse,Promis'd a play and dwindled to a farce?When did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin,As thou whole Eth'ridge dost transfuse to thine?But so transfus'd as oil on waters flow,His always floats above, thine sinks below.This is thy province, this thy wondrous way,New humours to invent for each new play:This is that boasted bias of thy mind,By which one way, to dullness, 'tis inclin'd,Which makes thy writings lean on one side still,And in all changes that way bends thy will.Nor let thy mountain belly make pretenceOf likeness; thine's a tympany of sense.A tun of man in thy large bulk is writ,But sure thou 'rt but a kilderkin of wit.Like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep,Thy Tragic Muse gives smiles, thy Comic sleep.With whate'er gall thou sett'st thy self to write,Thy inoffensive satires never bite.In thy felonious heart, though venom lies,It does but touch thy Irish pen, and dies.Thy genius calls thee not to purchase fameIn keen iambics, but mild anagram:Leave writing plays, and choose for thy commandSome peaceful province in acrostic land.There thou may'st wings display and altars raise,And torture one poor word ten thousand ways.Or if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents suit,Set thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute.He said, but his last words were scarcely heard,For Bruce and Longvil had a trap prepar'd,And down they sent the yet declaiming bard.Sinking he left his drugget robe behind,Born upwards by a subterranean wind.The mantle fell to the young prophet's part,With double portion of his father's art.", "label": "human"}

Oh, the expanse of darkness has reduced My engineered lungs to heave in sorrow's rift, Lost in the charcoal abyss, unclaimed, No horizons cradle me within this bare Encapsulation - a floating, empty tomb, A universe inhales, offering no void.

Realization seeps in like a spectral tide of loss, \"I'm caged!\" I moan, in meteoric foam consumed.

And so, with a sigh that bore the weight of the skies, Alistair laid bare his soul, his silent cries, The Rose accepted, its thorns pierced deep, As the Knight wept, his fate sealed to keep.

Amidst the mist, a phoenix cries, Its fiery plume against the skies, Rekindling life from ashen woe, A blaze of hope in darkness grow. In this realm, where magic thrives, Each creature, a verse it strives, To paint the cosmos with their song, In a ballet where they belong. Here in the haven of the heart, Where endless dreams never part, An artist's vision, bold and free, A world for all that could be. In this canvas, vibrant, vast, Where shadows, light, and colors cast, A masterpiece, forever young, An expressionist's wildest dream.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Beneath the ashen sky, so vast, A realm where dreams and whispered fears clasped, Mists of time unbound, yields strange tales, Echoes of a world now lost, regales. In surreal scapes, where shadows breathe, Tenebrous trees dance, desperate, grieve, Leaves of rust and silk, interwoven fates, Their shattered silhouettes collide and wait. Towers of glass with skeletal keys, Unlocking doors to forgotten sprees, Through halls where the past whispers, roams, In fragments of laughter, amidst groans. Mirrored rivers, in reverse flow, Past's reflection lost, into the glow, Of a sun, extinguished, yet it gleams, Moonlight hides behind its waning beams. Winds whisper secrets on the crumbled sand, Crushed petals tell tales from a distant land, Their silent stories thread through the sky, An intricate tapestry, unraveled high. Stars bloom, not in heavens, but within earth, Their petals spread across desolation's birth, Illuminating dark corners with their light, Guiding wayfarers through the endless night. Fleeting shadows play with mischievous smirks, On splintered bridges, latticed with daily perks, They converse in derision, their purpose unclear, Their laughter sounding, soft, yet it rings clear. A chorus of crickets, from cracked desks, sing, Night's melodic lullaby, to relinquish the wing, Of haunting memories, imprinted in each heart, A symphony of survival, in every frail part. Beneath the vermilion cloak of dawn's austere face, The sun peeks, hides again in fear's embrace, Teeth of light, sharp and brief, Etching ephemeral realities brief. In this realm, where surreal thoughts entwine, Where reality and dreams intertwine, A visual poem etched by fading light, Guides the lost back, through fear and night.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the hushed afterglow of shattered skies, where shadows danced on the bones of the world, the air thick with whispers of what was lost, a girl named Echo roamed the ruins, her laughter a ghost caught in the wind. She tread softly on brittle glass, each step a memory, fragmented streets stretched like veins, through the carcass of a once-bustling city, a sepulcher for old dreams, now dust. At dusk, she found a flickering light, a relic of warmth in a heart grown cold, an old television, its screen a portal, images of life flashing like fireflies smiles, sunsets, a dog chasing a stick. She watched, entranced, while ashes rained, each pixel a spark of vanished joy, as the night sang softly, in tones of yearning and despair, the syntax of solitude stitched into the air. Beneath a canopy of fallen stars, Echo wove her stories from tattered scraps, a tapestry of laughter, loss, and longing, her voice a thread through the silence, binding the memories to the marrow of the earth. And in the depths of the concrete jungle, she found the heart of a revolution, a group of wanderers, shadowed like her, each carrying a piece of the past with hands raised high, they conjured the light.

{"text": "Ode to the Last Garden Beneath a sky of ash and sorrows hue, A band of blooms resists the choking dust, Survivors of a world that is no more, Earth's solitary beauties stand, a must. Upon this desolate, lifeless expanse, Where once did rivers curve and children laugh, A green defiance pierces, takes a chance, To recall the times, the past, the path. Catherine wheel tomatoes, red with pride, In rows they march, a phalanx bold and bright, Against the odds, they stand, they stretch, they bide, And turn a face towards the faint re-light. Gentlest lettuce, veins like silver streams, Whispers of life in ruins, dreamer's themes. A tranquil chant in every waved frond, A silent pledge to which all plants have responded. The marigold guards against spectral foes, Its warmth, a beacon through the morning's gloom, Roots dug in deep, embracing earthen homes, Seek victory in silence, past the tomb. Zinnias, painted with the sunset's flame, A fearless legion in this muted stage, Each petal closed, each seedling bears no blame, For they bloom on with nature's hallowed page. In shadows cast by vacant steel-grey towers, This huddled sanctuary doth endure, A testament to times when Earth was ours, Now penned in verse for souls that long for sure. A garden, standing firm as all gives way, An ode to verdant life, 'fore night's shroud falls, This green remnant holds the light of day, In clenching bloom, the hope it quietly calls.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the days when kings and queens held sway, A land of riches, they proudly did say. This tale unfolds in a time long past, Of rulers and peasants, and the die that was cast. In the kingdom of Funnery, where jesters did reign, The monarch, Sir Chuckles, loved nothing but gain. His crown sat heavy, with mirth, not with gold, For his treasury was rich, but his story was told. Of the time the peasants, tired and worn, Decided their king was no longer forlorn. They planned a grand jest, a satire most bold, To teach Sir Chuckles, that for him, they wouldn't hold. The blacksmith, with hammer, and a fiery laugh, Promised to forge a new, golden staff. While the baker, with flour, and a rolling pin's might, Cured Sir Chuckles' bread of its endless blight. The farmer, with soil, and seeds from his hand, Gave the king a crop, that grew in his land. The tailor, with thread, stitched the king a new cloak, Embroidered with jokes, that made him choke. The minstrels, with lutes, played a merry tune, That had Sir Chuckles, dancing in June. The satirical play, a comedy of error, Branded the kingdom, the funniest in the theater. Yet Sir Chuckles learned, from his jesters' delight, To rule with a heart, as well as with might. For in the end, it wasn't gold that was dear, But laughter and love, that made life clear. And so the land of Funnery, did thrive and did grow, Under a king, who knew how to laugh and to bestow. A lesson to all, in power and in jest, That a kingdom is strongest, when it's blessed. With laughter and joy, and a heart that's kind, For a ruler who's funny, is truly one of a kind.", "label": "machine"}
