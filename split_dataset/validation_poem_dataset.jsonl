{"text": "Proportion Surviving Long before the fresh apple crisis, my life had some form to it. I would wake in the morningsI would perform something. For example, the day I tried, as one with acute passion might, to win one woman over but accidentally won anotherthat whole time I had been living like someone. Though I cant remember his name. His model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that I inhabit in time of need. This time the need was surprising. People tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk. And apples take their shape naturally. The guy, whose name escapes me now, taught me to look upon others concerns as mine to make at home. I was fond of doing many things at home, but my favorite was drinking juice. When my friends came bythey liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands, thinking they knew what I needed and planning to force it on meI had to tell them I was busy with my juice. Two weeks before the crisis, I had been writing some poems about it. It was a warm day, not entirely different from other warm days in San Francisco. People were on the street. Pale people were on the street, making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned. The poems I had written were failures, but dense ones. It seemed appropriate to think the persons attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps, which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people. I had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain, but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers cant help but enjoy. That day I had, in a sense, gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them. I awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for somethingnot anything life threatening, but definitely personal. My lover, then, wanted to spend much of her life asleep. She had no ostensible reaction to the citys sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them. In a world where a persons tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets, I could not find four people who cared. I thought that if I could find those four people we could really do something. A few of my friends pretended they were chosen. A few neighbors felt bad and made offers. My mother called to console me. My loverin actuality, the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop, slept next to me. Sleep became our network: falling in and out of it for change. The rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time. So I kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness. If by morning I could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing, she would reward me. Before the crisis, the reward would have needed only to be an apple one. But after the apples were gone. The landscape usually contains the solution to whats lost. Demographics help people in cars. Some people did not notice me. Some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me. That was two days before. The evening before it was two days before the crisis, I was thinking that I did not think I was asleep. I had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemates cat in it. When I looked again, there was no lightbut I had not been asleep. Its the way people react to traumatic events. They say, I had just been there or will say, She was just with me. So the loss of light was emotional and the lost statedemographic. I began to trace things by their disappearance. Alone in the room, my memory, and anticipated darkness going for light. People like to talk about the daytime. People in strange moods often miss the daytime. Before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods. I had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste. I was happy. I mean, I was in my juice. Five weeks before the crisis, I was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house. I did not really work there, but I went there every week. All but the third Sunday of each month, I would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale. Not to buy, but to stand next to. Shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs. That was one thing. I would stand there and be something for taller people who couldnt see. I had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed. My parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere. My father would always say, If youre not going to be a people person, then numbers will have to do. He was surprised that with all the time I had on my hands, I chose to spend most of it alone. Numbers then did hold some mystery for me, but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore. For years I had known that if there was a wall between where I was and where I needed to be, I did not want it there. Some people have personal goals that are demanding. Certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed. My decision to drink only fresh juice, which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast, kept me busy rounding up cash. I would have to leave most friendships behind. As a way of keeping my life wall-free, I had to divide my time. I would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories. The second part of my day I would spend telling people about the first part. The other parts are not of substance here. Twenty-five years before the crisis I had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice. Twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany. I am always drinking in my poems, a good friend says. In the first years of my life, everything I ate was mush. Today I will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this. When I had that remarkable glass of apple juice, I had no idea that one day I simply would not be able to find it. The city gets rid of its apples. People find themselves inventing fruit. The day I decided to write poems about itit was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverageI had been resting in my best friends easy chair. We were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me. Five days later I had twenty poems. When a person writes a poem about her passions, people on the street are bound to notice them. The passions overwhelm the body. She carries the body as though it were the book. The friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week, and though I miss her it was the failures that saved me. On every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful. If certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water, with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall, whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall. The person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly. In the alley behind the natural foods grocery, I met my second lover for the first time. Meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later. Or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present. And the weather was so hot during the crisis. Only the alleys had shade. Forty-eight days into the crisis, while on a thirst strike, I had to make a run for the alley. Not as though people were after me, but the elements. The foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need; at the bottom of any body-based need is grace. When I appeared at the opening of the alley, a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall. Women who work against surfaces inspire me to do thingsI thought about telling her, orshort women make me want things. All the time while I was growing up I put a lot of demands on my juice; forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it. I did not forget it, but was embroiled. The newspapers were saying things about the past. People were celebrating thick juice, and I kept writing those poems. That day in the alley I realized three things about life. While assisting her I learned three things to carry around with me, to disperse when needed. For six months during the crisis, I did not care about the crisis. When my faith returned all my lovers were gone. That morning I woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis; I was beneath my bed. It was the sixth day that I had awakened beneath my bed. I was lonely, but I was also sure. Life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character, whowhen we passed on the streetdid not know me. I knew it was me by the way my head felt: people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it. Today all my ideas are liquid. That day of my faith, friends thinking I was sick came by to see me. It would be the last day I spent alone; I was happy, but still would not drink. The juice on my mind was no longer juice. There was an absence there, but one so constant it became familiar. I did not want to drink it.", "label": "human"}

When on her hair she sets a crown of grass The thought has no more room for other lady, Because she weaves the yellow with the green So well that Love sits down there in the shade, Love who has shut me in among low hills Faster than between walls of granite-stone. She is more bright than is a precious stone; The wound she gives may not be healed with grass: I therefore have fled far oer plains and hills For refuge from so dangerous a lady; But from her sunshine nothing can give shade, Not any hill, nor wall, nor summer-green. A while ago, I saw her dressed in green, So fair, she might have wakened in a stone This love which I do feel even for her shade; And therefore, as one woos a graceful lady, I wooed her in a field that was all grass Girdled about with very lofty hills. Yet shall the streams turn back and climb the hills Before Loves flame in this damp wood and green Burn, as it burns within a youthful lady, For my sake, who would sleep away in stone My life, or feed like beasts upon the grass, Only to see her garments cast a shade.

{"text": "A Forsaken Garden In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland, At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee, Walled round with rocks as an inland island, The ghost of a garden fronts the sea. A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses The steep square slope of the blossomless bed Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses Now lie dead. The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken, To the low last edge of the long lone land. If a step should sound or a word be spoken, Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand? So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless, Through branches and briars if a man make way, He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless Night and day. The dense hard passage is blind and stifled That crawls by a track none turn to climb To the strait waste place that the years have rifled Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time. The thorns he spares when the rose is taken; The rocks are left when he wastes the plain. The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken, These remain. Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not; As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry; From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not, Could she call, there were never a rose to reply. Over the meadows that blossom and wither Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song; Only the sun and the rain come hither All year long. The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath. Only the wind here hovers and revels In a round where life seems barren as death. Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping, Haply, of lovers none ever will know, Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping Years ago. Heart handfast in heart as they stood, \"Look thither,\" Did he whisper? \"look forth from the flowers to the sea; For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither, And men that love lightly may diebut we?\" And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened, And or ever the garden's last petals were shed, In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened, Love was dead. Or they loved their life through, and then went whither? And were one to the endbut what end who knows? Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither, As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose. Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them? What love was ever as deep as a grave? They are loveless now as the grass above them Or the wave. All are at one now, roses and lovers, Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea. Not a breath of the time that has been hovers In the air now soft with a summer to be. Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep, When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter We shall sleep. Here death may deal not again for ever; Here change may come not till all change end. From the graves they have made they shall rise up never, Who have left nought living to ravage and rend. Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing, While the sun and the rain live, these shall be; Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing Roll the sea. Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble, Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink, Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink, Here now in his triumph where all things falter, Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread, As a god self-slain on his own strange altar, Death lies dead.", "label": "human"}

The proverb of our age, a caution we sow, When the seeds of greed, in the earth's soft furrow, grow, Remember the balance, let not the iron hand, Dictate the rhythm of life, lest all fall apart.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In twilight's hush, where shadows play Amidst the cypress trees, fare thee well To Elysium's gates, where ghosts do sway And mystic whispers whispered secrets tell Earthborn, I, a mortal, drew near The threshold forth, where ancient stones did drear The wind, a sigh, did softly whisper low \"Beware, mortal, lest thy steps doth slow\" I stepped forward, past the portal's might Into the realm of specters, endless night The moon, a ghostly galleon, rode the sky As I explored the land, where mystery did lie Through secretive woods, where wisps did dance And ghosts of battles, forgotten, did prance I stumbled upon, a cairn of old Where ancient runes, in silence, did unfold The trees, like sentinels, stood watchful and grey As I deciphered, the tales of yesterday Of Valhalla's warriors, fallen from the fight And mythical creatures, that in slumber took flight The sound of whispers, grew to a gentle hum As I drew near, the palace of the underworld's drum A threshold dark, where fate did not decide But mystery dwelled, in mists, that did not subside And I, a mortal, felt the presence near Of gods and goddesses, ethereal and stern They watched me, as, in riddles, I did stray Through realms of whispers, death, and endless day The wind, a sigh, did softly whisper low \"This is the realm, where secrets doth unfold\" And I, a mortal, felt the mystic dew As Elysium's gates, did slowly, shut anew", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In twilight's embrace, young hearts collide, With whispered dreams that dance on evenings breath, The world unfolds, a canvas rich and wide, Where love ignites the stars, a tender quest, Each moment, fleeting, caught in time's soft thread, As shadows lengthen, youth begins to fade. In laughter's echo, innocence is made, With every secret shared, a spark inside, The moonlit path, where hopes and fears are laid, In tender glances, promises bequeath, A fragile heart, entwined in joy and dread, As dawn draws near, the night begins to glide. Yet in the light, what truths shall be our guide? The trials of the heart, both bold and frail, Each step a story, woven in the tide, Of longing, loss, a bittersweet detail, A tapestry of love, where dreams are shed, And in the end, we rise, no longer played. For youth is but a river, swift and played, With currents fierce, and eddies deep and wide, Yet in its flow, we find the paths we tread, Through every heartache, every whispered tale, In passion's fire, we learn to brave the dread, And greet the dawn with arms, forever tied. So let us carve our names upon the glide, In echoes of the past, and future's breath", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "shadows creep along the edge of my vision, tendrils of fear coiling in the recesses of my mind, whispering secrets in my ear, breaths heavy with the scent of danger. my heart pounds, a relentless drummer in the cacophony of my pounding skull, racing against the seconds, against the looming specter of something unseen. thoughts cascade like waterfalls, each drop a fleeting idea, a fragment of the puzzle that binds me to this night, to this moment where reality blurs and fiction takes the reins. lights flicker, a stuttering heartbeat in the vast darkness, casting long, quivering shadows that dance upon the walls - phantoms of my own making, yet they stalk, they harass, they breath life into the corners of unease that settle deep within. silence is a thief, snatching sound from my ears, leaving only the echo of my own heartbeat to fill the void, the vacuum that threatens to swallow me whole. steps echo, a rhythmic cadence on the cold, unforgiving floor, each footfall a heavy thud in the symphony of suspense. my breath quickens, my chest tightens, the air thickens with the electricity of anticipation, the tangible tension of a story on the cusp of revelation. walls close in, the world narrows to the confines of this small, suffocating space, where every whisper, every sigh, every rustle could be the harbinger of doom. eyes dart, searching, always searching, a needle threading through the fabric of the night, stitching together the mosaic of fear and desire that paints the portrait of my existence at this critical juncture. danger lurks in the periphery, a malevolent figure obscured by the veil of the unseen, a specter that haunts the edge of perception, never fully materializing, yet always present. a silhouette emerges, a dark contour against the thrumming darkness, a presence that begins to unravel the tightly wound thread of my resolve. my pulse races, adrenaline surges, the boundaries of my sanity begin to fray at the edges. confrontation looms, an inevitable clash of wills, a battle waged not with weapons, but with the raw, unbridled fury of human emotion. in the breathless pause that follows, in that liminal space where past and future converge, I find my voice, a clarion call that pierces the veil of trepidation and demands recognition. the dance continues, a ballet of shadows and light, of fear and bravery, of the known and the unknown. as the night unfolds, revealing its secrets, I am both prisoner and master, the seeker and the sought, caught in the web of a thriller that is as much within as without. my thoughts whirl, a maelstrom of confusion and clarity, a potent mix that fuels the fire of my resolve. this is my story, my journey through darkness, a stream-of-consciousness odyssey that charts the course of my soul in a world that teeters on the brink of oblivion. I shall endure, I shall prevail, for in the heart of the thriller, I am the beating pulse of life itself.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the grand parade of life, where masks wear their owners, they march, adorned in costumes of sincerity stitched from the finest fabric of deceit. Here, the politicians stand tall, clutching promises like balloons tethered to the air, their ties whispering secrets of ambition stretched like elastic over smirks. They exchange glances like currency, nodding as if sagely but merely echoing the hollow chamber of agreements unsigned. At the marketplace of dreams, merchants peddle solace packed in sparkling adornments, while wisdom sits, cross-legged, offering truth at half its worth, yet no one buys. Consumers shuffle past, eyes aglow with longing for the things they already own. In this bustling bazaar, desires drown reason, and laughter is bartered for silence, a quiet deal sealed with invisible ink. Meanwhile, a poet scrawls on napkins the verses of their solitude, reciting to empty cafes where ghosts of inspiration sit sipping echoes of espresso. They call it art, but the critics raise glasses of skepticism, toasting to an artifice of achievement where the real applause is a whisper lost in the cacophony. The marching band plays on, its notes sharp and discordant, yet they march in stepthe harmony of chaos!through streets paved with good intentions, where saints are sinners and sinners saints. Applause erupts like an afterthought, too late to save the irony from itself, and thus the parade continues, led by jesters following", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "In the realm where shadows cast no night, And rivers flow in whispers of light, An ancient tree with roots woven deep In the heart of the world, where secrets sleep. Its leaves, they flicker in unseen breeze, Each a page from the universe's leas, Of tales untold and myths unwritten, Of a time when magic flowed unbidden. Beneath its boughs, a dance eternal, Where stars and comets perform their ritual, Their choreography of cosmic fire, Ignites the night with astral lyre. A garden blooms with flora unknown, Where fruit is wisdom from seeds sown, In soils rich with history's decay, Unearthed by time in a silent ballet. The tree observes with a knowing gaze, As mortals tread through the fog and haze, Seeking the fruit of knowledge so sweet, And finding, instead, their bitter defeat. Yet still the dance beneath its limbs, Unfolds as destiny shifts and hymns, To the surrealists, the dreamers of lore, May the tree's whispered tales unlock your door. For in its shadow lies the key, To worlds unbound by land and sea, To realms where time and space collapse, And mythic truths our reality reshape.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Gold dust trails in the wind, whispers of shadows, Silhouettes dance where the endless prairie begins. Two roads diverge under the solemn sun, Through stark beauty, where peace is found, yet torn. A solitary figure, his rifle a silence, A whispered oath to law, to land, to freedom. Men clad in hay, with dreams as broad as skies, In the heart of desolation, where solitude lies. A lonely horse, a truce with the wild, Moves with a grace that's been wild, purer, never mild. Echoes of bandits, ghost stories spun, In the whispers of the wind, in the setting sun. Through stark simplicity, where man and nature collide, In the pulse of the West, where hearts cannot hide. A tale of two souls, a life to embrace, In the quiet purity of this unrefined place. Monuments of time, ridges and valleys deep, Tales of valor, secrets to keep. In the echoes of silence, in the stars soft glow, In the Western solitude, where all truths flow.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In shadows cast by twilights fading breath, A figure stands alone beneath the trees, Where whispers of the past weave through the night, And echoes of a laughter long since lost Resound within the hollow of her heart. The moon, a witness to her silent grief, Illuminates the path of memories, Each step a ghostly trace of what once was, The tender touch of hands that now lie still, The promises that linger in the air. Time, that cruel and fickle mistress, mocks With every tick, a heartbeat torn apart, And in the distance, storms begin to brew, While love, a shipwrecked vessel on the shore, Is swallowed by the waves of dark despair. She dreams of words unsaid, of love unspent, A gaze that lingered just a breath too long, But fate, with jagged edges, cleaves the night, And sorrow drapes its cloak across her soul, A heavy shroud that drags her to the ground. Yet still she stands, a statue carved by loss, Against the winds that howl with hollow cries, For in her heart, a flicker faint but true, Reminds her of the warmth of sunlit days, Of laughter shared amidst the fleeting hours. But dreams are fragile, like the petals blown From blossoms once in bloom, now scattered wide, And as the dawn", "label": "machine"}
