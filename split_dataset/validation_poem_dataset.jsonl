He first enclosed within the gardens square A dead and standing pool of air,And a more luscious earth for them did knead, Which stupified them while it fed.The pink grew then as double as his mind; The nutriment did change the kind.With strange perfumes he did the roses taint, And flowers themselves were taught to paint. The tulip, white, did for complexion seek, And learned to interline its cheek:Its onion root they then so high did hold, That one was for a meadow sold.Another world was searched, through oceans new, To find the Marvel of Peru.", "label": "human"}

Why should of all things man unruld Such unproportiond dwellings build? The beasts are by their dens exprest, And birds contrive an equal nest; The low roofd tortoises do dwell In cases fit of tortoise-shell; No creature loves an empty space; Their bodies measure out their place. But he, superfluously spread, Demands more room alive than dead; And in his hollow palace goes Where winds as he themselves may lose. What need of all this marble crust Timpark the wanton mote of dust, That thinks by breadth the world tunite Though the first builders faild in height? But all things are composed here Like nature, orderly and near; In which we the dimensions find Of that more sober age and mind, When larger sized men did stoop To enter at a narrow loop; As practising, in doors so straight, To strain themselves through Heavens gate. And surely when the after age Shall hither come in pilgrimage, These sacred places to adore, By Vere and Fairfax trod before, Men will dispute how their extent Within such dwarfish confines went; And some will smile at this, as well As Romulus his bee-like cell. Humility alone designs Those short but admirable lines, By which, ungirt and unconstraind, Things greater are in less containd. Let others vainly strive timmure The circle in the quadrature! These holy mathematics can In evry figure equal man. Yet thus the laden house does sweat, And scarce endures the master great, But where he comes the swelling hall Stirs, and the square grows spherical; More by his magnitude distressd, Then he is by its straightness pressd, And too officiously it slights That in itself which him delights. So honour better lowness bears, Than that unwonted greatness wears; Height with a certain grace does bend, But low things clownishly ascend. And yet what needs there here excuse, Where evry thing does answer use? Where neatness nothing can condemn, Nor pride invent what to contemn? A stately frontispiece of poor Adorns without the open door; Nor less the rooms within commends Daily new furniture of friends. The house was built upon the place Only as for a mark of grace; And for an inn to entertain Its lord a while, but not remain. Him Bishops-Hill, or Denton may, Or Billbrough, better hold than they; But nature here hath been so free As if she said leave this to me.

{"text": "A Sequence of Sonnets on the Death of Robert Browning I The clearest eyes in all the world they read With sense more keen and spirit of sight more true Than burns and thrills in sunrise, when the dew Flames, and absorbs the glory round it shed, As they the light of ages quick and dead, Closed now, forsake us: yet the shaft that slew Can slay not one of all the works we knew, Nor death discrown that many-laurelled head. The works of words whose life seems lightning wrought, And moulded of unconquerable thought, And quickened with imperishable flame, Stand fast and shine and smile, assured that nought May fade of all their myriad-moulded fame, Nor England's memory clasp not Browning's name. II Death, what hast thou to do with one for whom Time is not lord, but servant? What least part Of all the fire that fed his living heart, Of all the light more keen that sundawn's bloom That lit and led his spirit, strong as doom And bright as hope, can aught thy breath may dart Quench? Nay, thou knowest he knew thee what thou art, A shadow born of terror's barren womb, That brings not forth save shadows. What art thou, To dream, albeit thou breathe upon his brow, That power on him is given thee,that thy breath Can make him less than love acclaims him now, And hears all time sound back the word it saith? What part hast thou then in his glory, Death? III A graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve: Venice and winter, hand in deadly hand, Have slain the lover of her sunbright strand And singer of a stormbright Christmas Eve. A graceless guerdon we that loved receive For all our love, from that the dearest land Love worshipped ever. Blithe and soft and bland, Too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave, Shone on our dreams and memories evermore The domes, the towers, the mountains and the shore That gird or guard thee, Venice: cold and black Seems now the face we loved as he of yore. We have given thee loveno stint, no stay, no lack: What gift, what gift is this thou hast given us back? IV But heto him, who knows what gift is thine, Death? Hardly may we think or hope, when we Pass likewise thither where to-night is he, Beyond the irremeable outer seas that shine And darken round such dreams as half divine Some sunlit harbour in that starless sea Where gleams no ship to windward or to lee, To read with him the secret of thy shrine. There too, as here, may song, delight, and love, The nightingale, the sea-bird, and the dove, Fulfil with joy the splendour of the sky Till all beneath wax bright as all above: But none of all that search the heavens, and try The sun, may match the sovereign eagle's eye.

No spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought, No faith, no fear, no dream, no rapture, nought That blooms in wisdom, nought that burns in crime, No virtue girt and armed and helmed with light, No love more lovely than the snows are white, No serpent sleeping in some dead soul's tomb, No song-bird singing from some live soul's height, But he might hear, interpret, or illume With sense invasive as the dawn of doom. VI What secret thing of splendour or of shade Surmised in all those wandering ways wherein Man, led of love and life and death and sin, Strays, climbs, or cowers, allured, absorbed, afraid, Might not the strong and sunlike sense invade Of that full soul that had for aim to win Light, silent over time's dark toil and din, Life, at whose touch death fades as dead things fade? O spirit of man, what mystery moves in thee That he might know not of in spirit, and see The heart within the heart that seems to strive, The life within the life that seems to be, And hear, through all thy storms that whirl and drive, The living sound of all men's souls alive? VII He held no dream worth waking: so he said, He who stands now on death's triumphal steep, Awakened out of life wherein we sleep And dream of what he knows and sees, being dead. But never death for him was dark or dread: \"Look forth\" he bade the soul, and fear not. Weep, All ye that trust not in his truth, and keep Vain memory's vision of a vanished head As all that lives of all that once was he Save that which lightens from his word: but we, Who, seeing the sunset-coloured waters roll, Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea, Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole, And life and death but shadows of the soul.", "label": "human"}

But since our Saviors death did put some blood Into thy face, Thou art grown fair and full of grace, Much in request, much sought for as a good.

{"text": "Syringa Orpheus liked the glad personal qualityOf the things beneath the sky. Of course, Eurydice was a part Of this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends Rocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks Cant withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon To the other, almost ready to give up wholeness. Then Apollo quietly told him: Leave it all on earth. Your lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to Follow, except a few birds of dusty feather,Not vivid performances of the past. But why not? All other things must change too.The seasons are no longer what they once were, But it is the nature of things to be seen only once,As they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along Somehow. Thats where Orpheus made his mistake. Of course Eurydice vanished into the shade;She would have even if he hadnt turned around.No use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel Of recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to utter an intelligentComment on the most thought-provoking element in its train. Only love stays on the brain, and something these people, These other ones, call life. Singing accuratelySo that the notes mount straight up out of the well of Dim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers Growing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulates The different weights of the things. But it isnt enough To just go on singing. Orpheus realized thisAnd didnt mind so much about his reward being in heaven After the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven Half out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them.Some say it was for his treatment of Eurydice.But probably the music had more to do with it, and The way music passes, emblematicOf life and how you cannot isolate a note of itAnd say it is good or bad. You mustWait till its over. The end crowns all,Meaning also that the tableauIs wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example, Melt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure That stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting; It is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal, Over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt, Harsh strokes. And to ask more than thisIs to become the tossing reeds of that slow,Powerful stream, the trailing grassesPlayfully tugged at, but to participate in the action No more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky Electric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth Into a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses Have each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks, Im a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me, Though I can understand the language of birds, and The itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me.Their jousting ends in music muchAs trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm And is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, day after day.But how late to be regretting all this, evenBearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late! To which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours, Replies that these are of course not regrets at all, Merely a careful, scholarly setting down ofUnquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way.And no matter how all this disappeared, Or got where it was going, it is no longer Material for a poem. Its subjectMatters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly While the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad Comet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward That the meaning, good or other, can never Become known. The singer thinksConstructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages Like a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away. The song is engulfed in an instant in blackness Which must in turn flood the whole continent With blackness, for it cannot see. The singer Must then pass out of sight, not even relieved Of the evil burthen of the words. Stellification Is for the few, and comes about much later When all record of these people and their lives Has disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm. A few are still interested in them. But what about So-and-so? is still asked on occasion. But they lie Frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorusSpeaks of a totally different incident with a similar name In whose tale are hidden syllablesOf what happened so long before thatIn some small town, one indifferent summer.", "label": "human"}

The bustling street, a dance of brakes, Coffee scents that the breeze partakes, In every step, a child's play, In morning light. A gentle hum as life awakes, New stories told, new paths to take, In bright array, the skys ballet, A vibrant call to seize the way, Embrace the joy the moment makes, In morning light.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "In the hush of twilight, shadows stretch, ancient whispers weave through the fabric of time, where stars, like scattered seeds, await the breath of creation. A river flows, silvered with moonlight, its waters cradle the dreams of the forgotten, each ripple a story, each wave a sigh of lost gods. Here, in the interstice of worlds, the veil thins, and spirits dance on the edge of the unseen, their laughter a melody, echoing through the corridors of existence. Mountains rise like sentinels, guardians of secrets etched in stone, while the wind carries the scent of old magic, a reminder of union, between earth and sky, flesh and spirit. Time unravels like threads of silk, each moment a bead in the necklace of eternity, and in this sacred tapestry, we are woven, each heart a pulse in the cosmic rhythm. The sun dips low, a dying ember, yet the horizon blooms with the promise of dawn, and in the silence, the universe breathes, an infinite loop of becoming, where all that was, and all that will be, is cradled in the arms of the eternal.", "label": "machine"}

The crystal throne, where dreams in slumber dwell, Beneath the watchful gaze of stars' appal, A tapestry of night, in quiet swell, Unfurls its silk to cloak the world in stral. The silent guardian, with his lantern bright, Illuminates the path with ghostly glow, Through murk and mist that guard the secret rite, Where time and mortal bounds do softly flow. In heart of night, where silent fires burn, The soul encounters truths it yearns to learn.", "label": "machine"}

{"text": "Upon the breath of dawns first light, A tale unfolds from shrouded night. In whispered tones of shadowed flight, A warrior's story etched in white. The land, once hushed by Lunas crescent, Now stirs beneath Helios ascent. A storm of destiny, fervently spent, Calls a fallen host to rise, resplendent. Lo brave Atalant, princess wise, Her heart, a chalice of both courage and guile. His sword, an expanse to traverse the mile, Where once he laid, his will now flies. With every step and heartbeats rune, The land heaving 'neath the crunching boon. Echoes of a lost, blood-cherry loon, Scream through canyons, a haunting tune. What phantom hand had dealt the blow, To raise the brave from deaths easy row? The curse that hung, a bitter coat, Upon the harvest moons last throw. Upon his sword, a legend's embossed, Of kingdoms fallen and battles lost. Each scar a sonnet, each scar a frost, Where valor bloomed and spirits crossed. He weaves through time, his lineage told, As the ember of the ancients stronghold. In the loom of fate, threads of old, A narrative of redemption bold. Atalants rally, as fates would sing, A chorus blossoming on warrior's wing. Through the maelstrom of a curses blight, Lit by hopes unyielding desire to ignite. So let the annals of valor ring, And the lost be found by the save of Spring. May the free verse of our hearts take wing, To immortalize their undying fling.", "label": "machine"}

Beneath the weight of dreams that none believe, Time drips like ink, obscuring every light, In shadows where the echoes softly weave. A fleeting glance, a moment to retrieve, Yet every memory fades out of sight, The heart, a fragile leaf that yearns to cleave. The moon, a distant eye that cannot grieve, Reflects the tears that vanish in the blight, In shadows where the echoes softly weave. We dance on edges, never to achieve The solace that a fleeting touch ignites, The heart, a fragile leaf that yearns to cleave. And so we wander, lost, we can't believe, In silent screams that fracture the still night, In shadows where the echoes softly weave, The heart, a fragile leaf that yearns to cleave.", "label": "machine"}
{"text": "Oh, the Humble Toaster, a slice of life's crumb In the kingdom of breakfast, where breads rise and come, You sit there, electric sentinel of the dawn, With buttons numbered like a gridiron on lawn. You're an artist, my friend, in hues of brown and black, A fiery alchemist, where crumbs and heat lack, No fancy oil paints or marble chiseled fine, Just slices of sourdough, and a dial to design. Twenty loaves a minute, you boast with a click, Pastries and bagels froth at your ironed lip, Yet the task at hand, a noble feat it is, Transforming the doughy into crisp gold bliss. Your slots a tender embrace where the bread unfolds, Leaving browning memoirs that warmth beholds, Of buttery mornings and jammed rendezvous, In the hallowed halls of the kitchen, you woo us. O, Toaster, you've outlived the mighty crockpot, The hasty microwave, the cold, sad cereal pot, Your warmth a blanket on breakfasts cold, lonely plate, In this ode of humor, you're the toast of our fate, So here's to the button that sparked our affection, The crumb tray that holds our morning's perfection, In this comedy of nourishment, you're the star, The humble Toaster, making our slices go far.", "label": "machine"}
