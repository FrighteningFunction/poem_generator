{"Poem": "Tulips The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.   I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietlyAs the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.   I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.   I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses   And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff   Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,   So it is impossible to tell how many there are.My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as waterTends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep.   Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage\u2014\u2014My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,   My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;   Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat   stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.   Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley   I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books   Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.   I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.I didn\u2019t want any flowers, I only wantedTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.How free it is, you have no idea how free\u2014\u2014The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them   Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.   The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe   Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.   Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.They are subtle : they seem to float, though they weigh me down,   Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,   A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.   The tulips turn to me, and the window behind meWhere once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,   And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow   Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,   And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself.   The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.Before they came the air was calm enough,Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.   Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river   Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.   They concentrate my attention, that was happy   Playing and resting without committing itself.The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;   They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,   And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closesIts bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,And comes from a country far away as health.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "Syringa Orpheus liked the glad personal qualityOf the things beneath the sky. Of course, Eurydice was a part   Of this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends   Rocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks   Can\u2019t withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon   To the other, almost ready to give up wholeness.   Then Apollo quietly told him: \u201cLeave it all on earth.   Your lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to   Follow, except a few birds of dusty feather,Not vivid performances of the past.\u201d But why not?   All other things must change too.The seasons are no longer what they once were,   But it is the nature of things to be seen only once,As they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along   Somehow. That\u2019s where Orpheus made his mistake.   Of course Eurydice vanished into the shade;She would have even if he hadn\u2019t turned around.No use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel   Of recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to utter an intelligentComment on the most thought-provoking element in its train.   Only love stays on the brain, and something these people,   These other ones, call life. Singing accuratelySo that the notes mount straight up out of the well of   Dim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers   Growing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulates   The different weights of the things.                                                       But it isn\u2019t enough   To just go on singing. Orpheus realized thisAnd didn\u2019t mind so much about his reward being in heaven   After the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven   Half out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them.Some say it was for his treatment of Eurydice.But probably the music had more to do with it, and   The way music passes, emblematicOf life and how you cannot isolate a note of itAnd say it is good or bad. You mustWait till it\u2019s over. \u201cThe end crowns all,\u201dMeaning also that the \u201ctableau\u201dIs wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example,   Melt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure   That stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting;   It is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal,   Over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt,   Harsh strokes. And to ask more than thisIs to become the tossing reeds of that slow,Powerful stream, the trailing grassesPlayfully tugged at, but to participate in the action   No more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky   Electric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth   Into a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses   Have each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks,   \u201cI\u2019m a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me,   Though I can understand the language of birds, and   The itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me.Their jousting ends in music muchAs trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm   And is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, day after day.\u201dBut how late to be regretting all this, evenBearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late!   To which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours,   Replies that these are of course not regrets at all,   Merely a careful, scholarly setting down ofUnquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way.And no matter how all this disappeared,   Or got where it was going, it is no longer   Material for a poem. Its subjectMatters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly   While the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad   Comet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward   That the meaning, good or other, can never   Become known. The singer thinksConstructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages   Like a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away.   The song is engulfed in an instant in blackness   Which must in turn flood the whole continent   With blackness, for it cannot see. The singer   Must then pass out of sight, not even relieved   Of the evil burthen of the words. Stellification   Is for the few, and comes about much later   When all record of these people and their lives   Has disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm.   A few are still interested in them. \u201cBut what about   So-and-so?\u201d is still asked on occasion. But they lie   Frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorusSpeaks of a totally different incident with a similar name   In whose tale are hidden syllablesOf what happened so long before thatIn some small town, one indifferent summer.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "The Advance 1 Out the barred window sandbags in a sagging wall surround the guard post where a soldier half-hidden by the flag holds his rifle on his knees and looks a little lost. It\u2019s Sunday and quiet, the traffic noise off aways, the sea behind the post flat as the tarps pulled tight over the troop trucks. Somewhere down the hall soldiers are being boys, telling some joke in Arabic in which I\u2019m pretty sure I hear the word \u201czubrak\u201d: I walk between shelves loaded with canned rations, the cool expiring slowly in the high-ceilinged roomwhile a pinned-up PSYOPS leaflet declares,If you sleep in a cemetery, you\u2019re bound to have nightmares. 2 No one sees the doll\u2019s decapitated head small and neat in rubble.

The TV station, the power stacks thrusting up through mist, the black-bearded postersand banners strung across the streets lead to an absolute nowhere:all that\u2019s left in the emptied town after the army pulled out are PSYOPS leaflets fluttering up around the car that winds down the coast road deeper into mist, headlightsprobing like instruments in a woundthey illuminate the more they violate.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "The Famous Tay Whale \u2019Twas in the month of December, and in the year 1883,That a monster whale came to Dundee,Resolved for a few days to sport and play,And devour the small fishes in the silvery Tay.So the monster whale did sport and playAmong the innocent little fishes in the beautiful Tay,Until he was seen by some men one day,And they resolved to catch him without delay.When it came to be known a whale was seen in the Tay,Some men began to talk and to say,We must try and catch this monster of a whale,So come on, brave boys, and never say fail.Then the people together in crowds did run,Resolved to capture the whale and to have some fun!So small boats were launched on the silvery Tay,While the monster of the deep did sport and play.Oh! it was a most fearful and beautiful sight,To see it lashing the water with its tail all its might,And making the water ascend like a shower of hail,With one lash of its ugly and mighty tail.Then the water did descend on the men in the boats,Which wet their trousers and also their coats;But it only made them the more determined to catch the whale,But the whale shook at them his tail.Then the whale began to puff and to blow,While the men and the boats after him did go,Armed well with harpoons for the fray,Which they fired at him without dismay.And they laughed and grinned just like wild baboons,While they fired at him their sharp harpoons:But when struck with the harpoons he dived below,Which filled his pursuers\u2019 hearts with woe:Because they guessed they had lost a prize,Which caused the tears to well up in their eyes;And in that their anticipations were only right,Because he sped on to Stonehaven with all his might:And was first seen by the crew of a Gourdon fishing boat,Which they thought was a big coble upturned afloat;But when they drew near they saw it was a whale,So they resolved to tow it ashore without fail.So they got a rope from each boat tied round his tail,And landed their burden at Stonehaven without fail;And when the people saw it their voices they did raise,Declaring that the brave fishermen deserved great praise.And my opinion is that God sent the whale in time of need,No matter what other people may think or what is their creed;I know fishermen in general are often very poor,And God in His goodness sent it to drive poverty from their door.So Mr John Wood has bought it for two hundred and twenty-six pound,And has brought it to Dundee all safe and all sound;Which measures 40 feet in length from the snout to the tail,So I advise the people far and near to see it without fail.Then hurrah! for the mighty monster whale,Which has got 17 feet 4 inches from tip to tip of a tail!Which can be seen for a sixpence or a shilling,That is to say, if the people all are willing.", "Label": "human"}

Vainly does each, as he glides,Fable and dreamOf the lands which the river of TimeHad left ere he woke on its breast,Or shall reach when his eyes have been closed.Only the tract where he sailsHe wots of; only the thoughts,Raised by the objects he passes, are his.Who can see the green earth any moreAs she was by the sources of Time?Who imagines her fields as they layIn the sunshine, unworn by the plough?Who thinks as they thought,The tribes who then roam'd on her breast,Her vigorous, primitive sons?What girlNow reads in her bosom as clearAs Rebekah read, when she sateAt eve by the palm-shaded well?Who guards in her breastAs deep, as pellucid a springOf feeling, as tranquil, as sure?

{"Poem": "from A Ballad Upon A Wedding I tell thee, Dick, where I have been,Where I the rarest things have seen;     Oh, things without compare!Such sights again cannot be foundIn any place on English ground,     Be it at wake, or fair.At Charing-Cross, hard by the way,Where we (thou know\u2019st) do sell our hay,     There is a house with stairs;And there did I see coming downSuch folk as are not in our town,     Vorty, at least, in pairs.Amongst the rest, one pest\u2019lent fine(His beard no bigger though than thine)     Walk\u2019d on before the rest:Our landlord looks like nothing to him:The King (God bless him) \u2019twould undo him,     Should he go still so drest.At Course-a-Park, without all doubt,He should have first been taken out     By all the maids i\u2019th\u2019 town:Though lusty Roger there had been,Or little George upon the Green,     Or Vincent of the Crown.But wot you what? the youth was goingTo make an end of all his wooing;     The parson for him stay\u2019d:Yet by his leave (for all his haste),He did not so much wish all past     (Perchance), as did the maid.The maid (and thereby hangs a tale)For such a maid no Whitsun-ale     Could ever yet produce:No grape, that\u2019s kindly ripe, could beSo round, so plump, so soft as she,     Nor half so full of juice.Her finger was so small, the ringWould not stay on, which they did bring;     It was too wide a peck:And to say truth (for out it must)It look\u2019d like the great collar (just)     About our young colt\u2019s neck.Her feet beneath her petticoat,Like little mice, stole in and out,     As if they fear\u2019d the light:But oh! she dances such a wayNo sun upon an Easter-day     Is half so fine a sight.He would have kissed her once or twice,But she would not, she was nice,     She would not do\u2019t in sight,And then she looked as who should sayI will do what I list to day;     And you shall do\u2019t at night.Her cheeks so rare a white was on,No daisy makes comparison,     (Who sees them is undone);For streaks of red were mingled there,Such as are on a Catherine pear     (The side that\u2019s next the sun).Her lips were red, and one was thin,Compar\u2019d to that was next her chin;     (Some bee had stung it newly);But (Dick) her eyes so guard her face,I durst no more upon them gaze     Than on the sun in July.Her mouth so small, when she does speak,Thou\u2019dst swear her teeth her words did break,     That they might passage get;But she so handled still the matter,They came as good as ours, or better,     And are not spent a whit.If wishing should be any sin,The Parson himself had guilty been;     (She looked that day so purely,)And did the youth so oft the featAt night, as some did in conceit,     It would have spoil\u2019d him, surely.Passion o\u2019 me, how I run on!There\u2019s that that would be thought upon     (I trow) besides the bride.The business of the kitchen\u2019s great,For it is fit that men should eat;     Nor was it there denied.Just in the nick the cook knock\u2019d thrice,And all the waiters in a trice     His summons did obey:Each serving-man, with dish in hand,March\u2019d boldly up, like our train\u2019d band,     Presented, and away.When all the meat was on the table,What man of knife or teeth was able     To stay to be intreated?And this the very reason was,Before the parson could say grace,     The company was seated.Now hats fly off, and youths carouse,Healths first go round, and then the house,     The bride\u2019s came thick and thick;And when \u2019twas nam\u2019d another\u2019s health,Perhaps he made it hers by stealth;     And who could help it, Dick?O\u2019 th\u2019 sudden up they rise and dance;Then sit again and sigh, and glance;     Then dance again and kiss:Thus sev\u2019ral ways the time did pass,Whilst ev\u2019ry woman wish\u2019d her place,     And ev\u2019ry man wish\u2019d his.By this time all were stol\u2019n asideTo counsel and undress the Bride;     But that he must not know:But yet \u2019twas thought he guess\u2019d her mind,And did not mean to stay behind     Above an hour or so.When in he came (Dick) there she layLike new-fal\u2019n snow melting away,     (\u2019Twas time I trow to part)Kisses were now the only stay,Which soon she gave, as who would say,     Good Boy! with all my heart.But just as heav\u2019ns would have to cross it,In came the Bridemaids with the Posset:     The Bridegroom eat in spite;For had he left the Women to\u2019tIt would have cost two hours to do\u2019t,     Which were too much that night.At length the candles out and out,All that they had not done, they do\u2019t:     What that is, who can tell?But I believe it was no moreThen thou and I have done before     With Bridget, and with Nell.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "The Negativo Trio NO was a violin, NOT a viola, and NEVER a cello. They were noble instruments, but highly nonconformist. Prickly in personality, if sexy. Wayward. Always went in their own direction. Made odd choices. Loved the difficult. Naysayed the popular. Collectively unified in a single reaction to the mainstream: negative.      When they first chanced to come together, they doubted they would ever meld.      But the minute they began to make music, they discovered a numinous core to their triangle. They couldn\u2019t see this core, smell it, or touch it\u2014and neither could their slender audience (thirty people on folding chairs in a church). But all felt it was a natural union of sound, nimble and sublime.     That night they became the Negativo Trio.     Retiring to nestle in the velvet warmth of their cases, they whispered to each other, debriefing and musing in the first of many nightly pajama parties. This very first evening they discovered that what they wanted above all were two things. One was to play their music with the very nacre of its nature, and the other was fame.     Night after night they played. Increased their bookings. Recorded. And were downloaded. They raised money to pay off the debt of their obscure choices. On stage they each shone with the patina of centuries: maple, spruce, and willow with an elegant varnish of gum arabic, honey, and the whites of eggs.     But they weren\u2019t famous, even though they played a nocturne as if every note were a black pearl.     Yet NO, NOT and NEVER did everything everyone advised them to be famous: they networked, they nodded nicely to publicists, they flashed their Negativo news on social media. But the fact was, the trio wasn\u2019t for everybody.     \u201cDo you think it\u2019s our name?\u201d NOT the Viola asked. \u201cWould we be more famous as the Nightingale Trio?\u201d     \u201cNope,\u201d said NEVER the Cello. \u201cNegativo has our brio.\u201d And NEVER was right. The three of them played with nerve. The knottier the piece, the better. They made their audiences reach.     \u201cWe should be sexier,\u201d NO the Violin said. \u201cNaughtier. It\u2019s our propensity for the minor key; we should lighten it up.\u201d But when they played in the minor key, their audiences felt they had arrived at the navel of the universe. The instruments could never give up the minor.     Would the Negativos ever learn what the people in the seats knew? The trio wasn\u2019t famous because, well, they kind of unnerved people. You had to have nettle to take them on.     Though they certainly wouldn\u2019t have said no to notoriety, eventually they had to admit that they could not surrender their quirks.     \u201cWe will never be famous,\u201d NEVER said one night after they had nestled in their cases for their midnight debriefing.     \u201cI\u2019m nauseous,\u201d said NO extravagantly.     \u201cAnd neglected,\u201d said NOT excessively.     \u201cNever,\u201d said NEVER decisively.     They would never fill the biggest halls. Or be the first name on the tips of tongues. And with the inverted logic of misplaced dreams, even though they had toured, had notched up review, and had triumphs and fans, and websites and bloggers, and a body of criticism devoted to them, they felt they had reached their nadir.     The next morning they couldn\u2019t seem to get up. They lay immobile, as if their velvet-lined cases were coffins.      A netherworldly silence descended.      The dust of despair drifted through the crack between the case tops and bottoms onto these living dead.     Time dragged like a dirty hem.     Naught into Nil.     Desolation into Dormancy.     Dormancy into . . .                                 . . . Rest.     Rest into Snoozing.     Snoozing into Sleep.     Sleep into Healing.     The nostrum of sleep lasted until the pinkish light that heralds spring.     A noisy nuthatch drilled for insects in a nearby tree. It was a forest sound, yodel-y and ebullient. It awoke the maple and spruce and willow of the Negativo\u2019s constitutions. Their bodies couldn\u2019t help responding to the vernal signal given when spring utters its only word: Nevertheless.      If not fame, nevertheless music.     \u201cNumbskull nuthatch!\u201d NEVER growled.     \u201cNinny nuthatch,\u201d NO yawned.     \u201cBumptious bird,\u201d NOT shifted, inadvertently jostling the snap to the dusty case. It sprang open. NO unclicked and climbed out, too. And NEVER heaved the lid.      They played immediately of course, trying a violin piece by the underrated Nardini. Most thought him a lightweight, but the Negativos gave it their signature interpretation of naked necessity.     \u201cOh it was NOTHING,\u201d they began to say to one another as they did musical favors for themselves, producing scores of synchronicities and the occasional juicy nihilistic dissonance. They buoyed on their notes, as if a midnight Pacific of calm, rich, dark negatives were effused with luminescence.      How relieved their listeners were to have them back. Again their audiences were made aware of the noses between their ears. That slight, brief piquancy in the nostrils was the smell of earthly harmony. It came from within the airy column that united the instruments, the nucleus of their refusal to suit. Such accord, though it is as rare as ease, seems like nothing.     And so the Negativo Trio was known as a trio\u2019s trio.     Not famous, but known.     Contrary to the vicissitudes of fame, ease is the path of the known, smooth as the satin of the instruments\u2019 finish. To be recognized, yet not to suffer the disadvantages of fame, is a state so ideal it is the pinnacle of a career. NO, NOT and NEVER had at last woken up to that.", "Label": "human"}

A passing skiffStartles a lone gravenche in Switzerland,Just as a pair of blue pike swerveTo avoid an anchor. The harelip suckerStays on course. A phantom shinerMight have swerved to snap up a three-tooth caddisfly,Or even Blackburn\u2019s weevil, but it\u2019s hard to tellWhy the white-winged sandpiper wheelsAt the distant warble of a black-footed parakeet.Gould\u2019s emerald has a tiny, ferocious heart.Domed Mauritius tortoises are clannish,Often clashing with saddle-backed Mauritius tortoises,Though the saddle-backed Rodrigues tortoiseEnjoys friendly relations with the domed Rodrigues tortoise.The Santa Fe Island tortoise keeps to itself, broodingOver its sufferings. The Japanese wolf sniffs the air.The Tasmanian wolf bursts into a sprint,The Arabian ostrich could outpace a sprinting bicyclist,And the legs of the sprinting red gazelle blur beneath it,Like the rapidly beating wings of the Kosrae crake.The Kosrae starling is nesting. In one treeThe Cascade funnel-web spider lays a trap,While in another, the American chestnut mothSleeps fitfully. The dodo is too trusting.The laughing owl can be heard across the island.The roar of the Caspian tiger resounds in a canyon.Children shudder at the sound of the Bombay lion.But not even the Caribbean monk sealHears the Caribbean monk seal mite silently makeIts home in the manner of the passenger pigeon mite,Burrowing into the ear canal. The warm river water Through which the Durango shiner dartsReflects a spectacled cormorant. On drafts of airA dusky seaside sparrow rises. Its shadow fallsOn a school of stumptooth minnows. The sunlightBarely filters down to a Bodensee-kilch,But a red-headed green macaw glimmers.The Kona grosbeak filches fruit from volcanoesSloping down to the shore where Gal\u00e1pagos damselsFrolic and spawn. The bezoule makes a rareAppearance. Heath hens gather by the pond.Only when the North Island giant moa starts to wonderAbout what happened to the South Island giant moaDoes the upland moa give any thoughtTo the whereabouts of the eastern moa. Meanwhile,The coastal moa seems to have gone offAfter the heavy-footed moa, which followsIn its turn the tracks of the crested moa,Wandering the islands looking for Mantell\u2019s moa.None of them have seen a bush moa in a while.Even as the quagga poses for its photograph,The St. Croix racer is slithering out of the frameIn eager pursuit of a big-eared hopping mouse.This may be the moment the Queen of Sheba\u2019s gazelleTakes its leave, along with the Atlas bear,The Palestinian painted frog, and several others.The aurochs left long ago. The lapping wavesEcho the strokes of the sea mink, but likeThe Japanese river otter, it\u2019s nowhereTo be seen. What will the confused moth do?The same as Darwin\u2019s rice rat. Years go by,And the Martinique macaw flies through none of them.Melville might have encountered a Nuka Hiva monarch,But Nabokov never pinned a Xerces blue.Cloned, the Pyrenean ibex livedA few seconds more. The paradise parrotSported the spectrum on its plumage. BluebucksOnly looked blue while alive. The Miller\u2019s railSurvives in a painting.

In our mouths, the tongue\u2019s               a knife, each word a wild edge, where we stammer                   only our own wound, a drop of blood sensual                   on the tongue, a distinctive taste of salt, more               mollusk perhaps\u2014wrapped around an I of sand\u2014                    than pearl, a syllable of milk or nipple, some                    private body within the body, the you behind              your eyes, as if being itself were poetry\u2014passionate            with nascent and protean neologism, full of the gaps             of being, the oblique richness of a depth in which we                begin to glimpse each other, mysterious and solo                       as we are, black stubborn pearls of being.                    If we spoke of Plato, and we don\u2019t; each of us                         was banished from the womb by virtue                   of having a womb, to this unpredictable realm                        where each of us would have to discover                    her self, that wild tongue\u2014never delineated,               even in shadow, upon the philosopher\u2019s cave wall.", "Label": "human"}

OBIIT MDCCCXXXIII: 27 I envy not in any moods          The captive void of noble rage,          The linnet born within the cage, That never knew the summer woods: I envy not the beast that takes          His license in the field of time,          Unfetter'd by the sense of crime, To whom a conscience never wakes; Nor, what may count itself as blest,          The heart that never plighted troth          But stagnates in the weeds of sloth; Nor any want-begotten rest. I hold it true, whate'er befall;          I feel it, when I sorrow most;          'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "the children of immigrants When I am a toddler, a child, a tween, a teen, and a young adult, I am called an ancestral soul, a ti gran moun, a little old person. Adults study me and decide that I am wise beyond my years, mature for my age, emotionally ripe. I am told it is unusual to meet a five-ten-fifteen-year-old girl who does not slouch or mumble or speak in monosyllables. When I do the things that come naturally to me\u2014when I hold my spine up erect, when I wait my turn to speak, when I speak having listened, carefully, when I enunciate, when I look grown-ups in the eye\u2014I am told I must have \u201cbeen here before.\u201d \"How do you know?\" one college professor asks me after she has seen a psychologically violent play I have written at age nineteen. \"How do you already know?\u201d In high school, I charm my teachers. They encourage me to write speeches about feminism that I recite for International Women's Day at City Hall or deliver as part of conference panels at local universities. \u201cIf you were older,\" they tell me, \"we would probably be friends.\u201d One of them even flirts with me. Among my peers I exist somewhere between amicably mysterious and irrevocably dorky. The popular kids greet me in the hallways, but they never invite me to their beer-drenched parties. I will never play Spin the Bottle. I will never play Seven Minutes in Heaven. My mother tells me she is protecting me from boys, but the truth is, after I do my homework, she wants me to type up another family friend\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or resignation letter. At home, I am a bridge, a cultural interpreter, a spokesperson, a trusted ally, an American who is Haitian too, but also definitely American. The children of immigrants don't get to be children. We lose our innocence watching our parents' backs bend, break. I am an old soul because when I am young, I watch my parents' spirits get slaughtered. In Haiti, they were middle class. Hopeful teachers. Home owners. They were black like their live-in servants. They donated clothes to the poor. They gave up everything they knew to inherit American dreams. And here, they join factory lines, wipe shit from mean old white men's behinds, scrub five-star hotel toilets for dimes above minimum wage. Here, they shuck and jive and step and fetch and play chauffeur to people who aren't as smart as they are, people who do not speak as many languages as they do. In the 1980s, they are barred from giving blood because newscasters and politicians say that AIDS comes from where they come from: Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, a black magic island that spawns boat people and chaos, a place of illiterate zombies, orphan beggars and brazen political corruption. When I am a child, my childhood is a luxury my family cannot afford. Their dignity is not spared, so my innocence is not spared. They are humiliated and traumatized daily, so I become a nurse to their trauma. I am told too much, so I know too much, so I am wise beyond my years. When I am six, my mother tells me that when she found out she was pregnant with me at age nineteen, she \u201ctried to kill the baby.\" She says \"the baby,\" as if it isn\u2019t me she\u2019s talking about; as if I am not the expensive, scandalous daughter who forced my way into her world despite the abortion-inducing herbal teas she drank and her frantic leaps off of small buildings. When I am sixteen, my father calls me on the phone to, inevitably, weep. He says, \"Living in this country, I have learned not to hope for things. Only you are my hope. Only you.\"So\u2014yes, I grow up fast.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "A Rhapsody of a Southern Winter Night Oh! dost thou flatter falsely, Hope?The day hath scarcely passed that saw thy birth, Yet thy white wings are plumed to all their scope, And hour by hour thine eyes have gathered light, And grown so large and bright,That my whole future life unfolds what seems,  Beneath their gentle beams,A path that leads athwart some guiltless earth, To which a star is dropping from the night!       Not many moons ago,But when these leafless beds were all aglow With summer\u2019s dearest treasures, IWas reading in this lonely garden-nook; A July noon was cloudless in the sky, And soon I put my shallow studies by; Then sick at heart, and angered by the book, Which, in good sooth, was but the long-drawn sigh Of some one who had quarreled with his kind, Vexed at the very proofs which I had sought, And all annoyed while all alert to find A plausible likeness of my own dark thought, I cast me down beneath yon oak\u2019s wide boughs, And, shielding with both hands my throbbing brows, Watched lazily the shadows of my brain. The feeble tide of peevishness went down, And left a flat dull waste of dreary pain Which seemed to clog the blood in every vein; The world, of course, put on its darkest frown\u2014In all its realms I saw no mortal crown Which did not wound or crush some restless head; And hope, and will, and motive, all were dead. So, passive as a stone, I felt too lowTo claim a kindred with the humblest flower; Even that would bare its bosom to a shower, While I henceforth would take no pains to live, Nor place myself where I might feel or give A single impulse whence a wish could grow. There was a tulip scarce a gossamer\u2019s throw Beyond that platanus. A little child,Most dear to me, looked through the fence and smiled A hint that I should pluck it for her sake. Ah, me! I trust I was not well awake\u2014       The voice was very sweet,Yet a faint languor kept me in my seat.I saw a pouted lip, a toss, and heardSome low expostulating tones, but stirredNot even a leaf\u2019s length, till the pretty fay, Wondering, and half abashed at the wild feat, Climbed the low pales, and laughed my gloom away.And here again, but led by other powers, A morning and a golden afternoon,These happy stars, and yonder setting moon, Have seen me speed, unreckoned and untasked,        A round of precious hours.Oh! here, where in that summer noon I basked, And strove, with logic frailer than the flowers, To justify a life of sensuous rest,A question dear as home or heaven was asked, And without language answered. I was blest!Blest with those nameless boons too sweet to trust Unto the telltale confidence of song.Love to his own glad self is sometimes coy,And even thus much doth seem to do him wrong; While in the fears which chasten mortal joy, Is one that shuts the lips, lest speech too free, With the cold touch of hard reality,Should turn its priceless jewels into dust.Since that long kiss which closed the morning\u2019s talk, I have not strayed beyond this garden walk. As yet a vague delight is all I know,A sense of joy so wild \u2019t is almost pain,And like a trouble drives me to and fro,And will not pause to count its own sweet gain. I am so happy! that is all my thought! To-morrow I will turn it round and round, And seek to know its limits and its ground. To-morrow I will task my heart to learn The duties which shall spring from such a seed, And where it must be sown, and how be wrought. But oh! this reckless bliss is bliss indeed! And for one day I choose to seal the urn Wherein is shrined Love\u2019s missal and his creed. Meantime I give my fancy all it craves;Like him who found the West when first he caught The light that glittered from the world he sought,And furled his sails till Dawn should show the land; While in glad dreams he saw the ambient waves Go rippling brightly up a golden strand.Hath there not been a softer breath at play In the long woodland aisles than often sweepsAt this rough season through their solemn deeps\u2014A gentle Ariel sent by gentle May,               Who knew it was the morn               On which a hope was born, To greet the flower ere it was fully blown, And nurse it as some lily of her own? And wherefore, save to grace a happy day, Did the whole West at blushing sunset glow With clouds that, floating up in bridal snow, Passed with the festal eve, rose-crowned, away! And now, if I may trust my straining sight, The heavens appear with added stars to-night, And deeper depths, and more celestial height,Than hath been reached except in dreams or death. Hush, sweetest South! I love thy delicate breath; But hush! methought I felt an angel\u2019s kiss! Oh! all that lives is happy in my bliss. That lonely fir, which always seemsAs though it locked dark secrets in itself,                Hideth a gentle elf,Whose wand shall send me soon a frolic troop Of rainbow visions, and of moonlit dreams. Can joy be weary, that my eyelids droop? To-night I shall not seek my curtained nest,               But even here find rest.Who whispered then? And what are they that peep Betwixt the foliage in the tree-top there? Come, Fairy Shadows! for the morn is near, When to your sombre pine ye all must creep; Come, ye wild pilots of the darkness, ere My spirit sinks into the gulf of Sleep; Even now it circles round and round the deep\u2014               Appear!

{"Poem": "from Upon Appleton House, to my Lord Fairfax Within this sober frame expect Work of no foreign architect; That unto caves the quarries drew, And forests did to pastures hew; Who of his great design in pain Did for a model vault his brain; Whose columns should so high be rais\u2019d To arch the brows that on them gaz\u2019d. Why should of all things man unrul\u2019d Such unproportion\u2019d dwellings build? The beasts are by their dens exprest, And birds contrive an equal nest; The low roof\u2019d tortoises do dwell In cases fit of tortoise-shell; No creature loves an empty space; Their bodies measure out their place. But he, superfluously spread, Demands more room alive than dead; And in his hollow palace goes Where winds as he themselves may lose. What need of all this marble crust T\u2019impark the wanton mote of dust, That thinks by breadth the world t\u2019unite Though the first builders fail\u2019d in height? But all things are composed here Like nature, orderly and near; In which we the dimensions find Of that more sober age and mind, When larger sized men did stoop To enter at a narrow loop; As practising, in doors so straight, To strain themselves through Heaven\u2019s gate. And surely when the after age Shall hither come in pilgrimage, These sacred places to adore, By Vere and Fairfax trod before, Men will dispute how their extent Within such dwarfish confines went; And some will smile at this, as well As Romulus his bee-like cell. Humility alone designs Those short but admirable lines, By which, ungirt and unconstrain\u2019d, Things greater are in less contain\u2019d. Let others vainly strive t\u2019immure The circle in the quadrature! These holy mathematics can In ev\u2019ry figure equal man. Yet thus the laden house does sweat, And scarce endures the master great, But where he comes the swelling hall Stirs, and the square grows spherical; More by his magnitude distress\u2019d, Then he is by its straightness press\u2019d, And too officiously it slights That in itself which him delights. So honour better lowness bears, Than that unwonted greatness wears; Height with a certain grace does bend, But low things clownishly ascend. And yet what needs there here excuse, Where ev\u2019ry thing does answer use? Where neatness nothing can condemn, Nor pride invent what to contemn? A stately frontispiece of poor Adorns without the open door; Nor less the rooms within commends Daily new furniture of friends. The house was built upon the place Only as for a mark of grace; And for an inn to entertain Its lord a while, but not remain. Him Bishops-Hill, or Denton may, Or Billbrough, better hold than they; But nature here hath been so free As if she said leave this to me. Art would more neatly have defac\u2019d What she had laid so sweetly waste; In fragrant gardens, shady woods, Deep meadows, and transparent floods.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "Les Saltimbanques I was walking from the Louvre to Place Saint-Michel along the Seine when I noticed a crowd gathered under a large linden tree. As I approached I thought how much I\u2019d liked to walk down Unter den Linden when I\u2019d lived in Berlin, and now I saw again how attractive the light green seeds of the linden tree were against the darker green of the leaves. I was also agog to see what had caused the crowd to gather.As I neared I heard a mother say to her little boy, \u201cRegardez, S\u00e9bastien, les saltimbanques.\u201dSaltimbanques? This was a new word to me. I had a quick look on my iPhone and came up with the translation \u201cmountebank.\u201d I pushed my way as politely as possible through the crowd until I had a good view. It was a family of street performers. They had improvised a small stage on the wide pavement, and a father, mother, and ten-year-old or so boy were up there. The man was dressed in a striking yellow and blue outfit with white leggings and black shoes, and was banging a little drum rhythmically while the boy in a checked black-and-white jumpsuit capered about, playing thumb rolls on a tambourine, with a black-and-white dog dancing in perfect step alongside him. The woman dressed all in white sat on a stool playing quick dance music on a red tin whistle. On her head was a white floppy hat, sitting on which was a snowy owl who periodically flew in a circle over the heads of the crowd, coming back to land on the white hat. It was a scene worthy of being painted by the young Picasso, or the old Chagall. Or maybe by Gustave Dor\u00e9. The boy on stage didn\u2019t look in the best of health, but I hoped I was wrong. The effect of the whole performance was strange and utterly charming. And the little troupe seemed to have emerged from another era\u2009\u2014\u2009from that of Baudelaire, even.I was puzzled by the translation offered by my iPhone, however. What I understood by the English word \u201cmountebank\u201d (which seemed very archaic) was either a person who sold quack medicines in public places, or a charlatan. These performers were no fakes. And yet, the English word, like the French, seemed to suggest the jumping up onto a stage. I\u2019d have to revisit my Shakespeare plays\u2009\u2014\u2009I seemed to remember that he\u2019d liked using that word.When the white hat came round I put a \u20ac20 note into it, took a quick photograph of les saltimbanques and made my way to the nearest metro. I was almost surprised to see cars and motorbikes clogging the road.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "Paradise Lost: Book \u00a02 (1674 version) HIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind, Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold, Satan exalted sat, by merit rais'd To that bad eminence; and from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue Vain Warr with Heav'n, and by success untaught His proud imaginations thus displaid. Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n, For since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n, I give not Heav'n for lost.   From this descent Celestial vertues rising, will appear More glorious and more dread then from no fall, And trust themselves to fear no second fate: Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n Did first create your Leader, next free choice, With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne Yielded with full consent.   The happier state In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw Envy from each inferior; but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Formost to stand against the Thunderers aim Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain? where there is then no good For which to strive, no strife can grow up there From Faction; for none sure will claim in Hell Precedence, none, whose portion is so small Of present pain, that with ambitious mind Will covet more.   With this advantage then To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord, More then can be in Heav'n, we now return To claim our just inheritance of old, Surer to prosper then prosperity Could have assur'd us; and by what best way, Whether of open Warr or covert guile, We now debate; who can advise, may speak. He ceas'd, and next him Moloc, Scepter'd King Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by despair: His trust was with th' Eternal to be deem'd Equal in strength, and rather then be less Car'd not to be at all; with that care lost Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse He reck'd not, and these words thereafter spake. My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles, More unexpert, I boast not: them let those Contrive who need, or when they need, not now. For while they sit contriving, shall the rest, Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame, The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns By our delay? no, let us rather choose Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way, Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see Black fire and horror shot with equal rage Among his Angels; and his Throne it self Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire, His own invented Torments.   But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumm not still, That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat: descent and fall To us is adverse.   Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep, With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low?   Th' ascent is easie then; Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction: if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd In this abhorred deep to utter woe; Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge Inexorably, and the torturing hour Calls us to Penance?   More destroy'd then thus We should be quite abolisht and expire. What fear we then? what doubt we to incense His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd, Will either quite consume us, and reduce To nothing this essential, happier farr Then miserable to have eternal being: Or if our substance be indeed Divine, And cannot cease to be, we are at worst On this side nothing; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n, And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: Which if not Victory is yet Revenge. He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous To less then Gods.   On th' other side up rose Belial, in act more graceful and humane; A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd For dignity compos'd and high exploit: But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear The better reason, to perplex and dash Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the ear, And with perswasive accent thus began. I should be much for open Warr, O Peers, As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success: When he who most excels in fact of Arms, In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution, as the scope Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd With Armed watch, that render all access Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, Scorning surprize.   Or could we break our way By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection, to confound Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemy All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire Victorious.   Thus repuls'd, our final hope Is flat despair: we must exasperate Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, And that must end us, that must be our cure, To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, Though full of pain, this intellectual being, Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, To perish rather, swallowd up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated night, Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, Let this be good, whether our angry Foe Can give it, or will ever? how he can Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, Belike through impotence, or unaware, To give his Enemies thir wish, and end Them in his anger, whom his anger saves To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe; Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the flames? or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague us? what if all Her stores were open'd, and this Firmament Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall One day upon our heads; while we perhaps Designing or exhorting glorious warr, Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; There to converse with everlasting groans, Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike My voice disswades; for what can force or guile With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides; Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. Shall we then live thus vile, the Race of Heav'n Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here Chains and these Torments? better these then worse By my advice; since fate inevitable Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, The Victors will.   To suffer, as to doe, Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd, If we were wise, against so great a foe Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear What yet they know must follow, to endure Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd With what is punish't; whence these raging fires Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel, Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd In temper and in nature, will receive Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, If we procure not to our selves more woe. Thus Belial with words cloath'd in reasons garb Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n We warr, if warr be best, or to regain Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then May hope when everlasting Fathe shall yeild To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife: The former vain to hope argues as vain The latter: for what place can be for us Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream We overpower?   Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all, on promise made Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble, and receive Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne With warbl'd Hymns, and to his God head sing Forc't Halleluia's; while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, Our servile offerings.   This must be our task In Heav'n this our delight; how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate.   Let us not then pursue By force impossible, by leave obtain'd Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek Our own good from our selves, and from our own Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, Free, and to none accountable, preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp.   Our greatness will appeer Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse We can create, and in what place so e're Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain Through labour and indurance.   This deep world Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd, And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell? As he our darkness, cannot we his Light Imitate when we please? This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; Nor want we skill or Art, from whence to raise Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more? Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements, these piercing Fires As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd Into their temper; which must needs remove The sensible of pain.   All things invite To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State Of order, how in safety best we may Compose our present evils, with regard Of what we are and were, dismissing quite All thoughts of warr: ye have what I advise. He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain The sound of blustring winds, which all night long Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay After the Tempest:   Such applause was heard As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas'd, Advising peace: for such another Field They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael Wrought still within them; and no less desire To found this nether Empire, which might rise By pollicy, and long process of time, In emulation opposite to Heav'n. Which when Beelzebub perceiv'd, then whom, Satan except, none higher sat, with grave Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and public care; And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look Drew audience and attention still as Night Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote Inclines, here to continue, and build up here A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League Banded against his Throne, but to remaine In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd, Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd His captive multitude: For he, be sure In heighth or depth, still first and last will Reign Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part By our revolt, but over Hell extend His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n. What sit we then projecting peace and Warr? Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n To us enslav'd, but custody severe, And stripes, and arbitrary punishment Inflicted? and what peace can we return, But to our power hostility and hate, Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow, Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, Or ambush from the Deep.   What if we find Some easier enterprize? There is a place (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n Err not) another World, the happy seat Of some new Race call'd Man, about this time To be created like to us, though less In power and excellence, but favour'd more Of him who rules above; so was his will Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath, That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power, And where thir weakness, how attempted best, By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut, And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd The utmost border of his Kingdom, left To their defence who hold it: here perhaps Som advantagious act may be achiev'd By sudden onset, either with Hell fire To waste his whole Creation, or possess All as our own, and drive as we were driven, The punie habitants, or if not drive, Seduce them to our Party, that thir God May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand Abolish his own works.   This would surpass Common revenge, and interrupt his joy In our Confusion, and our joy upraise In his disturbance; when his darling Sons HurI'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse Thir frail Original, and faded bliss, Faded so soon.   Advise if this be worth Attempting, or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd By Satan, and in part propos'd: for whence, But from the Author of all ill could Spring So deep a malice, to confound the race Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve, done all to spite The great Creatour?   But thir spite still serves His glory to augment.   The bold design Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate, Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms And opportune excursion we may chance Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires Shall breathe her balme.   But first whom shall we send In search of this new world, whom shall we find Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight Upborn with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick Of Angels watching round?   Here he had need All circumspection, and we now no less Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, The weight of all and our last hope relies. This said, he sat; and expectation held His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd To second, or oppose, or undertake The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each In others count'nance read his own dismay Astonisht: none among the choice and prime Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found So hardie as to proffer or accept Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais'd Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake. O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones, With reason hath deep silence and demurr Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light; Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, Outrageous to devour, immures us round Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant Barr'd over us prohibit all egress. These past, if any pass, the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into whatever world, Or unknown Region, what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd And judg'd of public moment, in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterr Mee from attempting.   Wherefore do I assume These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour, due alike To him who Reigns, and so much to him due Of hazard more, as he above the rest High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty Powers, Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home, While here shall be our home, what best may ease The present misery, and render Hell More tollerable; if there be cure or charm To respite or deceive, or slack the pain Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad Through all the Coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all: this enterprize None shall partake with me.   Thus saying rose The Monarch, and prevented all reply, Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd Others among the chief might offer now (Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard; And so refus'd might in opinion stand His Rivals, winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn.   But they Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; Thir rising all at once was as the sound Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone; and as a God Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n: Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd, That for the general safety he despis'd His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd Loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, Or clos ambition varnisht o're with zeal. Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre; If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive, The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. O shame to men!   Devil with Devil damn'd Firm concord holds, men onely disagree Of Creatures rational, though under hope Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: As if (which might induce us to accord) Man had not hellish foes anow besides, That day and night for his destruction waite. The Stygian Counsel thus dissolv'd; and forth In order came the grand infernal Peers, Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, And God-like imitated State; him round A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. Then of thir Session ended they bid cry With Trumpets regal sound the great result: Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim. Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers Disband, and wandring, each his several way Pursues, as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain The irksom hours, till this great Chief return. Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime Upon the wing, or in swift Race contend, As at th' Olympian Games or Pythian fields; Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir Spears Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns. Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when Alcides from Oechalia Crown'd With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th' Euboic Sea.   Others more milde, Retreated in a silent valley, sing With notes Angelical to many a Harp Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. Thir Song was partial, but the harmony (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment The thronging audience.   In discourse more sweet (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd, In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate, Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. Of good and evil much they argu'd then, Of happiness and final misery, Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm Pain for a while or anguish, and excite Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest With stubborn patience as with triple steel. Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps Might yield them easier habitation, bend Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; Cocytus, nam'd of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, Lethe the River of Oblivion roules Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, Forthwith his former state and being forgets, Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Beyond this flood a frozen Continent Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire. Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd, At certain revolutions all the damn'd Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. They ferry over this Lethean Sound Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, All in one moment, and so neer the brink; But Fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards The Ford, and of it self the water flies All taste of living wight, as once it fled The lip of Tantalus.   Thus roving on In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous, O're many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe, Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, A Universe of death, which God by curse Created evil, for evil only good, Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable, and worse Than Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd, Gorgons and Hydra's, and Chimera's dire. Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight; som times He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares Up to the fiery Concave touring high. As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring Thir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.   So seem'd Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass, Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, Impenetrable, impal'd with circling fire, Yet unconsum'd.   Before the Gates there sat On either side a formidable shape; The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair, But ended foul in many a scaly fould Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd With mortal sting: about her middle round A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb, And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd, Within unseen.   Farr less abhorrd than these Vex'd Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd In secret, riding through the Air she comes Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon Eclipses at thir charms.   The other shape, If shape it might be call'd that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd, For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night, Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. Satan was now at hand, and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd, Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except, Created thing naught valu'd he nor shun'd; And with disdainful look thus first began. Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance Thy miscreated Front athwart my way To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee: Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n. To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd, Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd To waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain? And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n, Hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, Thy King and Lord?   Back to thy punishment, False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, So speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold More dreadful and deform: on th' other side Incenst with indignation Satan stood Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd, That fires the length of Ophiucus huge In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair Shakes Pestilence and Warr.   Each at the Head Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands No second stroke intend, and such a frown Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on Over the Caspian, then stand front to front Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; For never but once more was either like To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung, Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between. O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd, Against thy only Son?   What fury O Son, Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom; For him who sits above and laughs the while At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute What e're his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore, then these to her Satan return'd: So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange Thou interposest, that my sudden hand Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends; till first I know of thee, What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st Me Father, and that Fantasm ca11'st my Son? I know thee not, nor ever saw till now Sight more detestable then him and thee. T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd; Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem Now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King, All on a sudden miserable pain Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide, Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright, Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid At first, and call'd me Sin, and for a Sign Portentous held me; but familiar grown, I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd A growing burden.   Mean while Warr arose, And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean: down they fell Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down Into this Deep, and in the general fall I also; at which time this powerful Key Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass Without my op'ning.   Pensive here I sat Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. At last this odious offspring whom thou seest Thine own begotten, breaking violent way Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out Death; Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems, Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far, Mee overtook his mother all dismaid, And in embraces forcible and foule Ingendring with me, of that rape begot These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd And hourly born, with sorrow infinite To me, for when they list into the womb That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw My Bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth A fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, That rest or intermission none I find. Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, And me his Parent would full soon devour For want of other prey, but that he knows His end with mine involvd; and knows that I Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd. But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint, Save he who reigns above, none can resist. She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire, And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know I come no enemie, but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain, Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd Fell with us from on high: from them I go This uncouth errand sole, and one for all My self expose, with lonely steps to tread Th' unfounded deep, and through the void immense To search with wandring quest a place foretold Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now Created vast and round, a place of bliss In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't A race of upstart Creatures, to supply Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd, Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught Then this more secret now design'd, I haste To know, and this once known, shall soon return, And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. The key of this infernal Pit by due, And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King I keep, by him forbidden to unlock These Adamantine Gates; against all force Death ready stands to interpose his dart, Fearless to be o'rmatcht by living might. But what ow I to his commands above Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, To sit in hateful Office here confin'd, Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born, Here in perpetual agonie and pain, With terrors and with clamors compasst round Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou My being gav'st me; whom should I obey But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss, among The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew, Which but her self not all the Stygian powers Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie With impetuous recoile and jarring sound Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook Of Erebus.   She op'nd, but to shut Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood, That with extended wings a Bannerd Host Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. Before thir eyes in sudden view appear The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark Illimitable Ocean without bound, Without dimension, where length, breadth, & highth, And time and place are lost; where eldest Night And Chaos.   Ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise Of endless Warrs, and by confusion stand. For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag Of each his Faction, in thir several Clanns, Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil, Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise Thir lighter wings.   To whom these most adhere, Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, And by decision more imbroiles the fray By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter Chance governs all.   Into this wilde Abyss, The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight, Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more Worlds, Into this wild Abyss the warie fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while, Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith He had to cross.   Nor was his eare less peal'd With noises loud and ruinous (to compare Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, With all her battering Engines bent to rase Som Capital City; or less then if this frame Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements In mutinie had from her Axle torn The stedfast Earth.   At last his Sail-broad Vannes He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets A vast vacuitie: all unawares Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour Down had been falling, had not by ill chance The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd, Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither Sea, Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth Had from his wakeful custody purloind The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, With head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: At length a universal hubbub wilde Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, Undaunted to meet there what ever power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, And Discord with a thousand various mouths. T' whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, Chaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy, With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint Wandring this darksome Desart, as my way, Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King Possesses lately, thither to arrive I travel this profound, direct my course; Directed no mean recompence it brings To your behoof, if I that Region lost, All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce To her original darkness and your sway (Which is my present journey) and once more Erect the Standard there of ancient Night; Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge. Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old With faultring speech and visage incompos'd Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, That mighty leading Angel, who of late Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown. I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host Fled not in silence through the frighted deep With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands Pursuing.   I upon my Frontieres here Keep residence; if all I can will serve, That little which is left so to defend, Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell: If that way be your walk, you have not farr; So much the neerer danger; go and speed; Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. He ceas'd; and Satan staid not to reply, But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, With fresh alacritie and force renew'd Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock Of fighting Elements, on all sides round Environ'd wins his way; harder beset And more endanger'd, then when Argo pass'd Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks: Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd Charybdis, and by th' other whirlpool steard. So he with difficulty and labour hard Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee; But hee once past, soon after when man fell, Strange alteration!   Sin and Death amain Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n, Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse With easie intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals, except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace. But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire As from her outmost works a brok'd foe With tumult less and with less hostile din, That Satan with less toil, and now with ease Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide In circuit, undetermind square or round, With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; And fast by hanging in a golden Chain This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "Medley of the Cut The column of the commander yielded to our first sweep.Even the water jar for our diggers we set on the south wallof the general\u2019s tomb without knowing it. So we began.His armies retook Nubia, Libya, and the Levant,lost under the sway-bellied lantern-jawed Sun King.Overseer of all scribes, Overseer of the priests of Horus,Grain-giver to all lands, Royal chief of staff, Regent,the general had himself carried on his palanquinthrough the wailing processionsto oversee the work on this place. And so carved, thus:one of his men punches a Nubian in the face.The general was low-born; everything had countedand he knew what counted most.His platoons lift open palms towards Tutankhamun.The general towers as a sway-girdled go-between at courtfor beseeching Libyans.Only the pearl-handled revolvers do not figure here,or the comeback challenge Nuts! in the Ardennes winter forest.He had himself carried beyond the busy streets of the deadin the city of the dead sloping back from the bluffto a higher, private terrace looking across to Memphis.But then he rose to Pharaoh. So he is not here. Insteadhis first wife lay here, and then his queen also.At his own royal tomb in the Valley, where the designsremained uncarved, sketching idea along stone,he does not rest either. The fine picklock handgot past Anubis and the reared serpents, and got to him,the Lord of Upper and Lower Egypt. It got past Truthwith her high feather, which moved at the slightest disturbance.The general did deep obeisance to her. He is not here.What at last moves the heart?So much already moved, even in his own century,architects prying loose mud bricks of the core for new tombs.Cult funded in perpetuity gone in two generations.So Coleridge, who was indisposed that day, prudentlyremained in the circle of lime trees while his friends went offon their walk through the countryside. He followed them in his mind.That way no one would have to dismantle Horeheb\u2019s outer courtto secure bricks for the statuary room, and facing stones.He cast his mind outward, a net over his dear ones,sending them at pace through the middle distance of steeples,hill lines, and the murder of Lamb\u2019s mother by his sister,a brief madness, thus through the appropriately middle distancewhere such things are built and performed in fact, no closer, no farther,then on out to the cleansing rim of apocalypse, eveningin the bath of waning fire, one bird stitchingthe whole veil of showings tight along its upper hem\u2014though he was not there, he could tell them that none the lesshe was next to his words and his word was with them, evenunto the rim of their wandering and their turning back.One dome of air and fire. But he was not there. Nor I here.What removes the heart from what moves it?As if I were the lecturer before a congress of doctors,his clinching point approaching, when suddenly he stared outin silence, and at last said, Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed colleagues,the only thing I can see at this moment inside my brain,such as it is, is a little white mouse chasing a little white ball.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "Six Songs of Love, Constancy, Romance, Inconstancy, Truth, and Marriage Oh! yet one smile, tho' dark may lower Around thee clouds of woe and ill, Let me yet feel that I have power, Mid Fate's bleak storms, to soothe thee still. Tho' sadness be upon thy brow, Yet let it turn, dear love, to me, I cannot bear that thou should'st know Sorrow I do not share with thee. True love's wreath is of mountain flowers, They stand the storm and brave the blast, And blossom on, so love like ours Is sweetest when all else is past. Too well I know what storms have frowned, And now frown on life's troubled tide; Still darker let them gather round, They have no power on hearts so tried. Then say not that you may not bear, To shadow spirit light as mine; I shall not shrink, or fear to share The darkest fate if it be thine!  Oh! say not love was never made For heart so light as mine; Must love then seek the cypress shade, Rear but a gloomy shrine. Oh! say not, that for me more meet The revelry of youth; Or that my wild heart cannot beat With deep devoted truth. Tho' mirth may many changes ring, 'Tis but an outward show, Even upon the fond dove's wing Will varying colours glow. Light smiles upon my lip may gleam And sparkle o'er my brow, 'Tis but the glisten of the stream That hides the gold below. 'Tis love that gilds the mirthful hour, That lights the smile for me, Those smiles would instant lose their power, Did they not glance on thee!  Oh! come to my slumber Sweet dreams of my love, I have hung the charmed wreath My soft pillow above. The roses are linked In a chain pure and white; And the rose-leaves are wet With the dew drops of night. The moon was on high As I gather'd each flower; The dew that then falls Has a magical power. The Spirit of slumber Those roses has blest; And sweet are the visions They'll bring to my rest. Be their spell on my soul, So they let me but see His dark eyes flash in love And his smile glance on me. Let sleep bring the image Of him far away; 'Tis worth all the tears I shed for him by day. I have hung the charmed wreath My soft pillow above; Then come to my slumber, Sweet dreams of my love!  How vain to cast my love away On bosom false as thine; The floweret's bloom, that springs in May, Would be a safer shrine To build my fondest hopes upon, Tho' fragile it may be. That flower's smile is not sooner gone Than love that trusts to thee. Love asks a calm, a gentle home, Or else its life is o'er; If once you let its pinions roam, Oh! then 'tis love no more. The aspin's changefuI shade can be No shelter for the dove; And hearts as varying as that tree, Are sure no place for love. Hope linger'd long and anxiously, O'er failing faith, but now I give thee back each heartless sigh, Give back each broken vow. I'll trust the stay of tulip dyes, The calm of yon wild sea, The sunshine of the April skies, But never more to thee!   Oh! would that love had power to raise A little isle for us alone, With fairy flowers, and sunny rays, The blue sea wave its guardian zone. No other step should ever press This hidden Eden of the heart, And we would share its loveliness, From every other thing apart. The rose and violet should weep, Whene'er our leafy couch was laid, The lark should wake our morning sleep, The bulbul sing our serenade. And we would watch the starry hours, And call the moon to hear our vows, And we would cull the sweetest flowers, And twine fresh chaplets for our brows.   I thought thus of the flowers, the moon, This fairy isle for you and me; And then I thought how very soon How very tired we should be.                    Matrimonial Creed.HE must be rich whom I could love, His fortune clear must be, Whether in land or in the funds, 'Tis all the same to me. He must be old whom I could love, Then he'll not plague me long; In sooth 'twill he a pleasant sight,To see him borne along To where the croaking ravens lurk, And where the earth worms dwell: A widow's hood will suit my face,And black becomes me well. And he must make a settlement, I'll have no man without; And when he writes his testament, He must not leave me out. Oh! such a man as this would suit Each wish I here express; If he should say, \u2014 Will you have me? I'll very soon say \u2014 Yes! \u2060", "Label": "human"}
{"Poem": "The Summer Bower It is a place whither I\u2019ve often goneFor peace, and found it, secret, hushed, and cool, A beautiful recess in neighboring woods. Trees of the soberest hues, thick-leaved and tall, Arch it o\u2019erhead and column it around, Framing a covert, natural and wild,Domelike and dim; though nowhere so enclosed But that the gentlest breezes reach the spot Unwearied and unweakened. Sound is here A transient and unfrequent visitor;Yet if the day be calm, not often then, Whilst the high pines in one another\u2019s arms Sleep, you may sometimes with unstartled ear Catch the far fall of voices, how remote You know not, and you do not care to know. The turf is soft and green, but not a flower Lights the recess, save one, star-shaped and bright\u2014I do not know its name\u2014which here and there Gleams like a sapphire set in emerald.A narrow opening in the branched roof,A single one, is large enough to show,With that half-glimpse a dreamer loves so much, The blue air and the blessing of the sky.Thither I always bent my idle steps,When griefs depressed, or joys disturbed my heart, And found the calm I looked for, or returned Strong with the quite rapture in my soul.                                         But one day,One of those July days when winds have fled One knows not whither, I, most sick in mind With thoughts that shall be nameless, yet, no doubt, Wrong, or at least unhealthful, since though dark With gloom, and touched with discontent, they had No adequate excuse, nor cause, nor end,I, with these thoughts, and on this summer day, Entered the accustomed haunt, and found for once No medicinal virtue.                    Not a leafStirred with the whispering welcome which I sought, But in a close and humid atmosphere,Every fair plant and implicated boughHung lax and lifeless. Something in the place, Its utter stillness, the unusual heat,And some more secret influence, I thought, Weighed on the sense like sin. Above I saw, Though not a cloud was visible in heaven,The palid sky look through a glazed mistLike a blue eye in death.                         The change, perhaps, Was natural enough; my jaundiced sight,The weather, and the time explain it all:Yet have I drawn a lesson from the spot,And shrined it in these verses for my heart. Thenceforth those tranquil precincts I have sought Not less, and in all shades of various moods; But always shun to desecrate the spotBy weak repinings, sickly sentiments,Or inconclusive sorrows. Nature, thoughPure as she was in Eden when her breathKissed the white brow of Eve, doth not refuse,In her own way and with a just reserve, To sympathize with human suffering; But for the pains, the fever, and the fret Engendered of a weak, unquiet heart,She hath no solace; and who seeks her when These be the troubles over which he moans, Reads in her unreplying lineaments Rebukes, that, to the guilty consciousness, Strike like contempt.", "Label": "human"}

Still, while you yet wander, you can not resist telling her your joke: Guy sees a pig with three legs, asks the farmer, What gives? Farmer says, That pig woke my family from a fire, got us all out.

In peace there's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility: But when the blast of war blows in our ears, Then imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage; Then lend the eye a terrible aspect; Let pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it As fearfully as doth a galled rock O'erhang and jutty his confounded base, Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean. Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide, Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height. On, on, you noblest English. Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof! Fathers that, like so many Alexanders, Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheathed their swords for lack of argument: Dishonour not your mothers; now attest That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you. Be copy now to men of grosser blood, And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman, Whose limbs were made in England, show us here The mettle of your pasture; let us swear That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not; For there is none of you so mean and base, That hath not noble lustre in your eyes. I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, Straining upon the start. The game's afoot: Follow your spirit, and upon this charge Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'", "Label": "human"}

In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A stately pleasure-dome decree: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man    Down to a sunless sea. So twice five miles of fertile ground With walls and towers were girdled round; And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding sunny spots of greenery. But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! A savage place! as holy and enchanted As e\u2019er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon-lover! And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced: Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher\u2019s flail: And mid these dancing rocks at once and ever It flung up momently the sacred river. Five miles meandering with a mazy motion Through wood and dale the sacred river ran, Then reached the caverns measureless to man, And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean; And \u2019mid this tumult Kubla heard from far Ancestral voices prophesying war!    The shadow of the dome of pleasure    Floated midway on the waves;    Where was heard the mingled measure    From the fountain and the caves. It was a miracle of rare device, A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!    A damsel with a dulcimer    In a vision once I saw:    It was an Abyssinian maid    And on her dulcimer she played,    Singing of Mount Abora.    Could I revive within me    Her symphony and song,    To such a deep delight \u2019twould win me, That with music loud and long, I would build that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice!

There\u2019s dogs, hammers, backhoes or serious earthmovers if today is not your day. How can the birds get a peep or a chirp in edgewise, I would like to know? But this morning is different, only a soft clicking sound and the low talk of two workmen working on the house next door, laying tile I am guessing. Otherwise, all quiet for a change, just the clicking of tiles being handled and their talking back and forth in Spanish then one of them asking in English \u201cWhat was her name?\u201d and the silence of the other.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "Ancestor It was a time when they were afraid of him.My father, a bare man, a gypsy, a horsewith broken knees no one would shoot.Then again, he was like the orange tree,and young women plucked from him sweet fruit.To meet him, you must be in the right place,even his sons and daughter, we wonderedwhere was papa now and what was he doing.He held the mystique of travelersthat pass your backyard and disappear into the trees.Then, when you follow, you find nothing,not a stir, not a twig displaced from its bough.And then he would appear one night.Half covered in shadows and half in light,his voice quiet, absorbing our unspoken thoughts.When his hands lay on the table at breakfast,they were hands that had not fixed our crumbling home,hands that had not taken us into themand the fingers did not gently rub along our lips.They were hands of a gypsy that filled our home   with love and safety, for a moment;with all the shambles of boards and empty stomachs,they filled us because of the love in them.Beyond the ordinary love, beyond the coordinated life,   beyond the sponging of broken hearts,came the untimely word, the fallen smile, the quiet tear,that made us grow up quick and romantic.Papa gave us something: when we paused from work,my sister fourteen years old working the cotton fields,my brother and I running like deer,we would pause, because we had a papa no one could catch,who spoke when he spoke and bragged and drank,he bragged about us: he did not say we were smart,nor did he say we were strong and were going to be rich someday.   He said we were good. He held us up to the world for it to see,three children that were good, who understood love in a quiet way,who owned nothing but calloused hands and true freedom,and that is how he made us: he offered us to the wind,to the mountains, to the skies of autumn and spring.He said, \u201cHere are my children! Care for them!\u201dAnd he left again, going somewhere like a childwith a warrior\u2019s heart, nothing could stop him.My grandmother would look at him for a long time,and then she would say nothing.She chose to remain silent, praying each night,guiding down like a root in the heart of earth,clutching sunlight and rains to her ancient breast.And I am the blossom of many nights.A threefold blossom: my sister is as she is,my brother is as he is, and I am as I am.Through sacred ceremony of living, daily living,arose three distinct hopes, three loves,out of the long felt nights and days of yesterday.", "Label": "human"}

Yet space is given for breath of thought     Beyond our bounds when musing: more     When to that musing love is brought,     And love is asked of love's wherefore.

From thy projecting head-land I would mark Far in the east the shades of night disperse, Melting and thinned, as from the dark blue wave Emerging, brilliant rays of arrowy light Dart from the horizon; when the glorious sun Just lifts above it his resplendent orb. Advances now, with feathery silver touched, The rippling tide of flood; glisten the sands, While, inmates of the chalky clefts that scar Thy sides precipitous, with shrill harsh cry, Their white wings glancing in the level beam, The terns, and gulls, and tarrocks, seek their food, And thy rough hollows echo to the voice Of the gray choughs, and ever restless daws, With clamor, not unlike the chiding hounds, While the lone shepherd, and his baying dog, Drive to thy turfy crest his bleating flock. The high meridian of the day is past, And Ocean now, reflecting the calm Heaven, Is of cerulean hue; and murmurs low The tide of ebb, upon the level sands.

{"Poem": "The Imperfect Enjoyment Naked she lay, clasped in my longing arms, I filled with love, and she all over charms; Both equally inspired with eager fire, Melting through kindness, flaming in desire. With arms, legs, lips close clinging to embrace, She clips me to her breast, and sucks me to her face. Her nimble tongue, love\u2019s lesser lightning, played Within my mouth, and to my thoughts conveyed Swift orders that I should prepare to throw The all-dissolving thunderbolt below. My fluttering soul, sprung with the pointed kiss, Hangs hovering o\u2019er her balmy brinks of bliss. But whilst her busy hand would guide that part Which should convey my soul up to her heart, In liquid raptures I dissolve all o\u2019er, Melt into sperm, and spend at every pore. A touch from any part of her had done \u2019t: Her hand, her foot, her very look's a cunt.    Smiling, she chides in a kind murmuring noise, And from her body wipes the clammy joys, When, with a thousand kisses wandering o\u2019er My panting bosom, \u201cIs there then no more?\u201d She cries. \u201cAll this to love and rapture\u2019s due; Must we not pay a debt to pleasure too?\u201d     But I, the most forlorn, lost man alive, To show my wished obedience vainly strive: I sigh, alas! and kiss, but cannot swive. Eager desires confound my first intent, Succeeding shame does more success prevent, And rage at last confirms me impotent. Ev\u2019n her fair hand, which might bid heat return To frozen age, and make cold hermits burn, Applied to my dear cinder, warms no more Than fire to ashes could past flames restore. Trembling, confused, despairing, limber, dry, A wishing, weak, unmoving lump I lie. This dart of love, whose piercing point, oft tried, With virgin blood ten thousand maids has dyed, Which nature still directed with such art That it through every cunt reached every heart\u2014 Stiffly resolved, \u2019twould carelessly invade Woman or man, nor ought its fury stayed: Where\u2019er it pierced, a cunt it found or made\u2014 Now languid lies in this unhappy hour, Shrunk up and sapless like a withered flower.     Thou treacherous, base deserter of my flame, False to my passion, fatal to my fame, Through what mistaken magic dost thou prove So true to lewdness, so untrue to love? What oyster-cinder-beggar-common whore Didst thou e\u2019er fail in all thy life before? When vice, disease, and scandal lead the way, With what officious haste doest thou obey! Like a rude, roaring hector in the streets Who scuffles, cuffs, and justles all he meets, But if his king or country claim his aid, The rakehell villain shrinks and hides his head; Ev\u2019n so thy brutal valor is displayed, Breaks every stew, does each small whore invade, But when great Love the onset does command, Base recreant to thy prince, thou dar\u2019st not stand. Worst part of me, and henceforth hated most, Through all the town a common fucking post, On whom each whore relieves her tingling cunt As hogs on gates do rub themselves and grunt, Mayst thou to ravenous chancres be a prey, Or in consuming weepings waste away; May strangury and stone thy days attend; May\u2019st thou never piss, who didst refuse to spend When all my joys did on false thee depend.

She\u2019s the oneWho signed up me and KolyaFor this interview with Lanzmann.She\u2019s also beautiful and young.A little older than usBut she looks younger.Whereas me and Kolya,We don\u2019t want to look younger.One of us is thirty-three,The other\u2019s thirty-four.Not yet at the peakOf our powers,We\u2019re gathering forceAnd preparing to strike.We\u2019re like LanzmannWho at the age of eighteenJoined the FrenchCommunist Party.He joined not becauseHe read Marx or LeninBut because he was askedBy his friendsIn the Resistance.We are like LanzmannWho cried when he learnedOf the death of Stalin.He cried not becauseHe loved StalinBut because he wasSentimental:He saw SovietSailorsLowering their flags to half-mast,And thought about howThe Soviet peopleHad absorbed,During the war,The most terribleAnd frightful blows.We are like LanzmannWho in 1949Made the acquaintanceOf Sartre and SimoneDe Beauvoir.He began to work with themOn the magazineLes Tempes modernes.And today he isThat publication\u2019sEditor in chief.We are like LanzmannWho in 1972Made the filmIsrael, Why,Which, in the wordsOf the online encyclopedia,\u201cDid not shy away fromDifficult questions.\u201dWe discussed all our questionsIn advance of the interview.Inside us it was as ifSome keys, cold and hot,Were rattling. It\u2019s nearly freezing out.Meanwhile I was thinking about howKolya is a rude artist.In the sense thatThere are radical artistsEverywhere you look,But not so manyGenuinely rude artists.The rudeness of an artist,I thought,Is an interesting quality.But now Channel One is leaving,Kolya takes off his jacket with its skullsAnd sets up our cameras.\u201cWe are the representatives of the left,\u201d we say.Lanzmann lowers his gaze wearily:Now they\u2019re going to start in about Israel.But Kolya, having explained a bitAbout his art collective,Asks Lanzmann insteadAbout monumentalArt:\u201cMonumentalArt. What might it look likeRight now?\u201d\u201cHow should I know?\u201dSays Lanzmann.\u201cThere could be noMonumentalArtToday.The world is scattered. ForA monumentalWork you needA unified senseOf the world.\u201d\u201cBut you yourselfFilmed a monumentalWork. Surely you haveSome ideas on this score?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think aboutThat.

As I saidEarlier, only lifeHas any meaning.) \u2022 \u201cDoes the termThe \u2018Holocaust Industry\u2019Mean anything to you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t wantTo talkAbout Israel.I repeat:You are thinkingIn abstractCategories.\u201d\u201cYes, but your filmBecame the centerOf intellectualDebate\u2009\u2014\u2009About the uniquenessOf the Holocaust,About the supposedAnti-SemitismOf the Poles.

Cautiously,as if they might awaken, we clambered overthe gigantic slabs and humps, the sun-baked ovalslumpy as hammered clay, and saw downstream below usonly the vague shapes of others, almost billowy,like magnified amoebas, stretching away to evenvaguer ones beyond them, turning the narrowstreambed through the valley to a lunar seam.       2Easing ourselves down over the massive sides(we were hot and tired, eager for the pools below)we could make out older water in the rough grain,undulating and immobile currents, band swirled on band,mica-speckled, cloudy, each seeming to move off,as it faded, through the stone\u2014each one a glacial rune,each boulder an innumerable pebble in the ice sheet\u2019stidal suck and drag: two hundred thousand years,two billion, five, the molten core, spoorof gasses in the vast night, at our fingertips.       3Then the pool: your clothes shed, with one hand bracedagainst the rock ledge you had slipped into the hip-highrushing water, and were wading out, bent over, reachinglike the blind before you for the slippery boulderyou slid across, pushing against the white weightof the pouring mist, your skin goose-fleshed, speckledbright as mica, and then, part mist yourself,you turned back, smiling, calling though I couldn\u2019thear you, calling and waving for me to climb downto where you were, to join you there.

{"Poem": "Proportion Surviving Long before the fresh apple crisis, my life had some form to it. I would wake in the mornings\u2014I would perform something. For example, the day I tried, as one with acute passion might, to win one woman over but accidentally won another\u2014that whole time I had been living like someone. Though I can\u2019t remember his name. His model of optimism provided me with a certain geography that I inhabit in time of need. This time the need was surprising. People tend to have faith that the juice they drink in the morning is the same juice they have always drunk. And apples take their shape naturally. The guy, whose name escapes me now, taught me to look upon others\u2019 concerns as mine to make at home. I was fond of doing many things at home, but my favorite was drinking juice. When my friends came by\u2014they liked to suddenly show up with all kinds of breads in their hands, thinking they knew what I needed and planning to force it on me\u2014I had to tell them I was busy with my juice. Two weeks before the crisis, I had been writing some poems about it. It was a warm day, not entirely different from other warm days in San Francisco. People were on the street. Pale people were on the street, making it to the park and lying there such that the next day they were a little browned. The poems I had written were failures, but dense ones. It seemed appropriate to think the person\u2019s attempt at wholeness was a series of missteps, which if drawn across an afternoon might prove interesting to other people. I had a way of reminding my friends that we were all in pain, but a fruit tart kind of pain strangers can\u2019t help but enjoy. That day I had, in a sense, gathered all my possessions and gone out onto the street with them. I awoke that morning with an urgency to prepare myself for something\u2014not anything life threatening, but definitely personal. My lover, then, wanted to spend much of her life asleep. She had no ostensible reaction to the city\u2019s sudden depletion of all its fresh apples and no hope for them. In a world where a person\u2019s tastes revolve around the kind of sleep she gets, I could not find four people who cared. I thought that if I could find those four people we could really do something. A few of my friends pretended they were chosen. A few neighbors felt bad and made offers. My mother called to console me. My lover\u2014in actuality, the closest person to being a member of the encumbered troop, slept next to me. Sleep became our network: falling in and out of it for change. The rule of survival is that no two people can lie in the same bed and sleep at the same time. So I kept an eye on her and played this game of freshness. If by morning I could quickly run out and do seven things that did not involve longing, she would reward me. Before the crisis, the reward would have needed only to be an apple one. But after the apples were gone. The landscape usually contains the solution to what\u2019s lost. Demographics help people in cars. Some people did not notice me. Some demographers lose sleep and do not notice me. That was two days before. The evening before it was two days before the crisis, I was thinking that I did not think I was asleep. I had been watching the sunlight take the corner of my room and my housemate\u2019s cat in it. When I looked again, there was no light\u2014but I had not been asleep. It\u2019s the way people react to traumatic events. They say, \u201cI had just been there\u201d or will say, \u201cShe was just with me.\u201d So the loss of light was emotional and the lost state\u2014demographic. I began to trace things by their disappearance. Alone in the room, my memory, and anticipated darkness going for light. People like to talk about the daytime. People in strange moods often miss the daytime. Before the crisis it was not often that one would find me in strange moods. I had managed a particular kind of balance fortified by a certain satisfaction of taste. I was happy. I mean, I was in my juice. Five weeks before the crisis, I was employed at the natural foods grocery around the corner from my house. I did not really work there, but I went there every week. All but the third Sunday of each month, I would walk in and find all kinds of juice on sale. Not to buy, but to stand next to. Shorter people have the privilege of proximity to most cardboard signs. That was one thing. I would stand there and be something for taller people who couldn\u2019t see. I had gotten into the habit of improvised customer service as a way to peruse the juice aisles without being noticed. My parents thought my talents should have led me somewhere. My father would always say, \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to be a people person, then numbers will have to do.\u201d He was surprised that with all the time I had on my hands, I chose to spend most of it alone. Numbers then did hold some mystery for me, but mostly too high and far-reaching to explore. For years I had known that if there was a wall between where I was and where I needed to be, I did not want it there. Some people have personal goals that are demanding. Certain goals make it impossible to lounge around in bed. My decision to drink only fresh juice, which costs as much as a small satisfying breakfast, kept me busy rounding up cash. I would have to leave most friendships behind. As a way of keeping my life \u201cwall-free,\u201d I had to divide my time. I would spend the first part of the day searching for volunteer positions in organic juice factories. The second part of my day I would spend telling people about the first part. The other parts are not of substance here. Twenty-five years before the crisis I had for the first time what would eventually become known to me as apple juice. Twenty-three years later a magazine editor would reject my first attempt to recount that experience in litany. I am always drinking in my poems, a good friend says. In the first years of my life, everything I ate was mush. Today I will tolerate only the toughest of green vegetables and date people who will always forget this. When I had that remarkable glass of apple juice, I had no idea that one day I simply would not be able to find it. The city gets rid of its apples. People find themselves inventing fruit. The day I decided to write poems about it\u2014it was twelve days before the rumors began and fourteen days before the media coverage\u2014I had been resting in my best friend\u2019s easy chair. We were discussing the rise of the smoothie industry when something fantastic occurred to me. Five days later I had twenty poems. When a person writes a poem about her passions, people on the street are bound to notice them. The passions overwhelm the body. She carries the body as though it were the book. The friend whose easy chair gave way to my failures moved out of town the next week, and though I miss her it was the failures that saved me. On every other day any kind of crisis one finds particular sayings helpful. If certain words are spoken quietly into a cup of hot water, with the handle of the cup turned toward the wall, whatever strength found in the person may be mirrored in the wall. The person leaves the house with her hand against this wall but strutting slightly. In the alley behind the natural foods grocery, I met my second lover for the first time. Meeting people in vulnerable places accentuates the passion later. Or it may be so hot that the lover never thinks in the present. And the weather was so hot during the crisis. Only the alleys had shade. Forty-eight days into the crisis, while on a thirst strike, I had to make a run for the alley. Not as though people were after me, but the elements. The foundation of anyone feeling that they must get away is need; at the bottom of any body-based need is grace. When I appeared at the opening of the alley, a woman who not twenty-four hours later would be dozing in my bed was stacking crates against the east-side wall. Women who work against surfaces inspire me to do things\u2014I thought about telling her, or\u2014short women make me want things. All the time while I was growing up I put a lot of demands on my juice; forty-eight days into the crisis she made me forget it. I did not forget it, but was embroiled. The newspapers were saying things about the past. People were celebrating thick juice, and I kept writing those poems. That day in the alley I realized three things about life. While assisting her I learned three things to carry around with me, to disperse when needed. For six months during the crisis, I did not care about the crisis. When my faith returned all my lovers were gone. That morning I woke to the two hundred and thirty-second day of the crisis; I was beneath my bed. It was the sixth day that I had awakened beneath my bed. I was lonely, but I was also sure. Life without juice had taken on the name and shape of my weakest character, who\u2014when we passed on the street\u2014did not know me. I knew it was me by the way my head felt: people find themselves in an idea and feel so specified by the idea that they are compelled to show it. Today all my ideas are liquid. That day of my faith, friends thinking I was sick came by to see me. It would be the last day I spent alone; I was happy, but still would not drink. The juice on my mind was no longer juice. There was an absence there, but one so constant it became familiar. I did not want to drink it.", "Label": "human"}

And the awful figure bendingover Jane\u2019s bed with the candle, that monstrouscreature\u2014well, there are flaws in the mind of Jane, too,and the awful figure bending over hermight be the tormented wife of Rochester.There\u2019s a flaw in Jane\u2019s mind, too,looking down on the young French childborn to another tormented motherwhom Rochester says has inherited sin.The young French child likes presents too much,likes to dance and sing\u2014and so what?

My shoe\u2019s a doily.Without it, where would I be on these shellsThat crunch underfoot, like contact lenses,As I gingerly walk, on my mermaid wayBack to my husband in his human dwelling?Someone is pulling a blue toy trawlerAlong the horizon to port, so smoothlyIt looks realistic. Sea\u2019s partly doily.Surfers ride its lace to their downfall,After all, we\u2019re nothing but froth.Like a carpet salesman, the indolent tideFlops a wave over, showing samples: \u201cMadam,This one is durable, has a fringe.\u201d UnderIts breath the sea sighs, \u201cHas it comeTo this? Must everything always end in ... doily?\u201dIt must. Broad afternoon. The rain-cloud bargesHave passed and here\u2019s a cumulonimbus paradeOf imperial busts, the Roman rulersIn historical order which, I think, would please you.Their vapor curls and noble foreheadsAre lit up in lilac because they\u2019re invadingThe west. Next come the philosophers and, last of all,The poets. Pulleys draw them delicately on.Here comes Lucretius, then Ovid, then HoraceIn lines, saying relentlessly, \u201cDoily,\u201d \u201cDoily,\u201dTill stars take over and do the same.", "Label": "human"}

And while no one would hire Monty Cliftafter his facially disfiguring car-wreck,Brando convinced the studio that the other, slightlyolder, kid from Omaha was the right man.No one could play a more sensitive-tough than Monty,like the artist-bugler-boxer Prewittmistaken for the enemy, gunned downby his own men in the Pearl Harbor dawn;or the way, as the seraphic cowboy Matt Dunson,he got a rise out of his demented empire builderfather, John Wayne, by kicking over a tin cup,sloshing the coffee into the dust to show his disgust.Clift knew that Lions director Edward Dmytrykwas searching for someone to play a keysupporting role\u2014as Frank Sinatra had in From Here ToEternity\u2014yet he was stunned to hear it was\u201cJerry Lewis\u2019s partner in shlock.\u201dClift softened, nauseated when he sawMartin\u2019s competitionpander to the crowd on Broadway.Lucky for Monty that he let it go: the two mennot only became friends; it was Deanwho put the man with the wired-jaw to bedwhen he had the chloral hydrate and alcohol wobblies.Ignorant of Brando\u2019s intervention on his behalf,Monty told Dean that Marlon\u2019s fifty takes per scenewere getting on his nerves more and moreand he vowed to walk off the set if he triedONE MORE TIME to have his German soldier diewith arms spread wide to \u201cecho the crucifixion.\u201dClift, wasted with self-recrimination at forty-five.Martin, an actor for whom one run through a scenealmost always sufficed.Dean got a chuckle out of Monty with his response.\u201cIt should be awful good with so many takes.\u201dThen the future flashed before him.\u201cI guess there are directors who want us to dothe same scene over and over again too.\u201d\u201cSure, lots. Some of the best.\u201d\u201cI guess I got spoiled. Jerry and I gotto where we pretty much called the shots.\u201dAnd then\u2014without any foreknowledgethat he\u2019d be doing his only two otherserious roles in the next two yearsand be subject to directorial rule on the sets ofSome Came Running and Rio Bravo\u2014he vowed in the future to set up his golf netbefore shooting started on a picture.Dean appeared to float, perfectionnever an aspiration: that he was already as well knownfor his insouciance and drunk persona as forhis singing and acting doesn\u2019t mean he was so well-defendedthat he didn\u2019t feel any pressure about workingwith such aces as Brando and Clift.He didn\u2019t have to stretch to play a would-be draft dodger,Michael Whiteacre: \u201ca likeable coward like myself,\u201da screenwriter in Shaw\u2019s novel, a singer in the movie.The army doctor feeds Dean his first line in Lionsas if his future were visible in the instant:art and life exquisitely commingled.Doctor: \u201cFor a man your age and in your professionyou\u2019re in excellent health. How do you manage it?\u201dMartin doesn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cClean liquor.\u201dBut sauntering through this role didn\u2019t meaneverything was swell: he felt so out-of-placeon location in France he gave up the offer ofa choice part in The Guns of Navaronebecause it meant going back to Europe.In his middle years, he ambled through the roleof \u201cMatt Helm\u201d in another tonelessBondian takeoff, and when Columbiawanted to shoot Murderers\u2019 Rowon location in Cannes, Dinoset the studio straight: \u201cfuck no,just build some fake Riviera sets.\u201d                                                      2A diffident crooner, he needed a stooge.License to fuck around on stage.After his split with Jerry, Dino\u2019s drunk persona grewinto a ghostly partner, and by the time he had his own TV showthe public was so saturated with his presence,many conflated the persona and the person.When he landed the drunk\u2019s key role in Rio Bravo,he turned to Brando for help, \u201cwhat should I do?\u201dBrando told him what to think about.The more inscrutable the subjectthe more this spectre stands out in relief.Part of Martin\u2019s appeal was that no one knew him.It wasn\u2019t a mask; his detachment was who he was.He showed up, his spirit remained elsewhere.His wives and children found him unknowable.It wasn\u2019t personal. When the Martins entertained,the guests carried on while Dino disappearedinto his room to watch westerns on TV, alone.It wasn\u2019t personal. When the producer of\u201cThe Colgate Comedy Hour\u201d suggested they have lunchto get to know one another, Dinoset him straight: \u201cNo one gets to know me.\u201dMartin was a man no one came close to knowing.What does it mean, to know someone?                                                      3Why ask such questions at all after Socratesbeguiled us out of answers and set us onthe inexhaustible path...dialectics?Don\u2019t you think I haven\u2019t wondered if I haven\u2019tstrayed from my true path as I find myselftracking the trajectory of such non-exemplary lives?You\u2019re thinking it\u2019s a trick, and will not answer,but before you judge my dissolute subject\u2014who like the money but thought all the attentionwas a joke because \u201ca singer is nothing\u201d\u2014as a derelict choice, consider how philosophy,while striving to become more concretecontinues to recoil before the problem of other minds.And it is said that Monsieur Sartre turned palerthan his martini, when Raymond Aronchallenged the Husserlians, at the Bec de Gazin Montparnasse, to make philosophyout of a cocktail glass.                                                      4There\u2019s something about everyone no one can know.There was no question of Dino taking ordersand being bossed around was out of bounds:penalty shot incurred for the perpetrator,who was, this time, the imperious Billy Wilderwhose streak of hits was breaking fast.Dino as always was doing his job,which was to literally play himself in Kiss Me,Stupid", "Label": "human"}

Let us inspect, togetherWith his meticulous and serious love,The innards of this closet. Which is a vaultWhose glory is not diamonds, not pearls,Not silver plate with just enough dull shine.But wonder-suits in yellow and in wine,Sarcastic green and zebra-striped cobalt.With shoulder padding that is wideAnd cocky and determined as his pride;Ballooning pants that taper off to endsScheduled to choke precisely.

You forget and you forget.He dances down the hotel steps that keepRemnants of last night\u2019s high life and distress.As spat-out purchased kisses and spilled beer.He swallows sunshine with a secret yelp.Passes to coffee and a roll or two.Has breakfasted.

{"Poem": "Mac Flecknoe A Satire upon the True-blue Protestant Poet T.S.All human things are subject to decay,And, when Fate summons, monarchs must obey:This Flecknoe found, who, like Augustus, youngWas call'd to empire, and had govern'd long:In prose and verse, was own'd, without disputeThrough all the realms of Non-sense, absolute.This aged prince now flourishing in peace,And blest with issue of a large increase,Worn out with business, did at length debateTo settle the succession of the State:And pond'ring which of all his sons was fitTo reign, and wage immortal war with wit;Cry'd, 'tis resolv'd; for nature pleads that heShould only rule, who most resembles me:Shadwell alone my perfect image bears,Mature in dullness from his tender years.Shadwell alone, of all my sons, is heWho stands confirm'd in full stupidity.The rest to some faint meaning make pretence,But Shadwell never deviates into sense.Some beams of wit on other souls may fall,Strike through and make a lucid interval;But Shadwell's genuine night admits no ray,His rising fogs prevail upon the day:Besides his goodly fabric fills the eye,And seems design'd for thoughtless majesty:Thoughtless as monarch oaks, that shade the plain,And, spread in solemn state, supinely reign.Heywood and Shirley were but types of thee,Thou last great prophet of tautology:Even I, a dunce of more renown than they,Was sent before but to prepare thy way;And coarsely clad in Norwich drugget cameTo teach the nations in thy greater name.My warbling lute, the lute I whilom strungWhen to King John of Portugal I sung,Was but the prelude to that glorious day,When thou on silver Thames did'st cut thy way,With well tim'd oars before the royal barge,Swell'd with the pride of thy celestial charge;And big with hymn, commander of an host,The like was ne'er in Epsom blankets toss'd.Methinks I see the new Arion sail,The lute still trembling underneath thy nail.At thy well sharpen'd thumb from shore to shoreThe treble squeaks for fear, the basses roar:Echoes from Pissing-Alley, Shadwell call,And Shadwell they resound from Aston Hall.About thy boat the little fishes throng,As at the morning toast, that floats along.Sometimes as prince of thy harmonious bandThou wield'st thy papers in thy threshing hand.St. Andre's feet ne'er kept more equal time,Not ev'n the feet of thy own Psyche's rhyme:Though they in number as in sense excel;So just, so like tautology they fell,That, pale with envy, Singleton forsworeThe lute and sword which he in triumph boreAnd vow'd he ne'er would act Villerius more.Here stopt the good old sire; and wept for joyIn silent raptures of the hopeful boy.All arguments, but most his plays, persuade,That for anointed dullness he was made.     Close to the walls which fair Augusta bind,(The fair Augusta much to fears inclin'd)An ancient fabric, rais'd t'inform the sight,There stood of yore, and Barbican it hight:A watch tower once; but now, so fate ordains,Of all the pile an empty name remains.From its old ruins brothel-houses rise,Scenes of lewd loves, and of polluted joys.Where their vast courts, the mother-strumpets keep,And, undisturb'd by watch, in silence sleep.Near these a nursery erects its head,Where queens are form'd, and future heroes bred;Where unfledg'd actors learn to laugh and cry,Where infant punks their tender voices try,And little Maximins the gods defy.Great Fletcher never treads in buskins here,Nor greater Jonson dares in socks appear;But gentle Simkin just reception findsAmidst this monument of vanish'd minds:Pure clinches, the suburbian muse affords;And Panton waging harmless war with words.Here Flecknoe, as a place to fame well known,Ambitiously design'd his Shadwell's throne.For ancient Decker prophesi'd long since,That in this pile should reign a mighty prince,Born for a scourge of wit, and flail of sense:To whom true dullness should some Psyches owe,But worlds of Misers from his pen should flow;Humorists and hypocrites it should produce,Whole Raymond families, and tribes of Bruce.     Now Empress Fame had publisht the renown,Of Shadwell's coronation through the town.Rous'd by report of fame, the nations meet,From near Bun-Hill, and distant Watling-street.No Persian carpets spread th'imperial way,But scatter'd limbs of mangled poets lay:From dusty shops neglected authors come,Martyrs of pies, and reliques of the bum.Much Heywood, Shirley, Ogleby there lay,But loads of Shadwell almost chok'd the way.Bilk'd stationers for yeoman stood prepar'd,And Herringman was Captain of the Guard.The hoary prince in majesty appear'd,High on a throne of his own labours rear'd.At his right hand our young Ascanius satRome's other hope, and pillar of the state.His brows thick fogs, instead of glories, grace,And lambent dullness play'd around his face.As Hannibal did to the altars come,Sworn by his sire a mortal foe to Rome;So Shadwell swore, nor should his vow be vain,That he till death true dullness would maintain;And in his father's right, and realm's defence,Ne'er to have peace with wit, nor truce with sense.The king himself the sacred unction made,As king by office, and as priest by trade:In his sinister hand, instead of ball,He plac'd a mighty mug of potent ale;Love's kingdom to his right he did convey,At once his sceptre and his rule of sway;Whose righteous lore the prince had practis'd young,And from whose loins recorded Psyche sprung,His temples last with poppies were o'er spread,That nodding seem'd to consecrate his head:Just at that point of time, if fame not lie,On his left hand twelve reverend owls did fly.So Romulus, 'tis sung, by Tiber's brook,Presage of sway from twice six vultures took.Th'admiring throng loud acclamations make,And omens of his future empire take.The sire then shook the honours of his head,And from his brows damps of oblivion shedFull on the filial dullness: long he stood,Repelling from his breast the raging god;At length burst out in this prophetic mood:    Heavens bless my son, from Ireland let him reignTo far Barbadoes on the Western main;Of his dominion may no end be known,And greater than his father's be his throne.Beyond love's kingdom let him stretch his pen;He paus'd, and all the people cry'd Amen.Then thus, continu'd he, my son advanceStill in new impudence, new ignorance.Success let other teach, learn thou from mePangs without birth, and fruitless industry.Let Virtuosos in five years be writ;Yet not one thought accuse thy toil of wit.Let gentle George in triumph tread the stage,Make Dorimant betray, and Loveit rage;Let Cully, Cockwood, Fopling, charm the pit,And in their folly show the writer's wit.Yet still thy fools shall stand in thy defence,And justify their author's want of sense.Let 'em be all by thy own model madeOf dullness, and desire no foreign aid:That they to future ages may be known,Not copies drawn, but issue of thy own.Nay let thy men of wit too be the same,All full of thee, and differing but in name;But let no alien Sedley interposeTo lard with wit thy hungry Epsom prose.And when false flowers of rhetoric thou would'st cull,Trust Nature, do not labour to be dull;But write thy best, and top; and in each line,Sir Formal's oratory will be thine.Sir Formal, though unsought, attends thy quill,And does thy Northern Dedications fill.Nor let false friends seduce thy mind to fame,By arrogating Jonson's hostile name.Let Father Flecknoe fire thy mind with praise,And Uncle Ogleby thy envy raise.Thou art my blood, where Jonson has no part;What share have we in Nature or in Art?Where did his wit on learning fix a brand,And rail at arts he did not understand?Where made he love in Prince Nicander's vein,Or swept the dust in Psyche's humble strain?Where sold he bargains, whip-stitch, kiss my arse,Promis'd a play and dwindled to a farce?When did his muse from Fletcher scenes purloin,As thou whole Eth'ridge dost transfuse to thine?But so transfus'd as oil on waters flow,His always floats above, thine sinks below.This is thy province, this thy wondrous way,New humours to invent for each new play:This is that boasted bias of thy mind,By which one way, to dullness, 'tis inclin'd,Which makes thy writings lean on one side still,And in all changes that way bends thy will.Nor let thy mountain belly make pretenceOf likeness; thine's a tympany of sense.A tun of man in thy large bulk is writ,But sure thou 'rt but a kilderkin of wit.Like mine thy gentle numbers feebly creep,Thy Tragic Muse gives smiles, thy Comic sleep.With whate'er gall thou sett'st thy self to write,Thy inoffensive satires never bite.In thy felonious heart, though venom lies,It does but touch thy Irish pen, and dies.Thy genius calls thee not to purchase fameIn keen iambics, but mild anagram:Leave writing plays, and choose for thy commandSome peaceful province in acrostic land.There thou may'st wings display and altars raise,And torture one poor word ten thousand ways.Or if thou would'st thy diff'rent talents suit,Set thy own songs, and sing them to thy lute.He said, but his last words were scarcely heard,For Bruce and Longvil had a trap prepar'd,And down they sent the yet declaiming bard.Sinking he left his drugget robe behind,Born upwards by a subterranean wind.The mantle fell to the young prophet's part,With double portion of his father's art.", "Label": "human"}

It is far too expensive for me,but the handwritten label [1915] brings it to my chest in armfuls of red.In that year, someone drew a bladethrough a bolt of fabric and stitchedthis coat into being. I carry itto the dressing room, slip my arms in.Silk lining spills against my skin. I clasp the beltand draw a slow breath as a cramp curls again,where blood stirs and melts. In glass,I am wrapped in the weight of old red:red pinched into girl cheeks and smeared from torn knees, lipstick blotted on tissue, bitten lips, a rough kiss, all the red bled into pads and rags, the weight of red, the wait for red, that we share.

{"Poem": "Autumn Shade 1The autumn shade is thin. Grey leaves lie faintWhere they will lie, and, where the thick green was,Light stands up, like a presence, to the sky.The trees seem merely shadows of its age.From off the hill, I hear the logging crew,The furious and indifferent saw, the slowResponse of heavy pine; and I recallThat goddesses have died when their trees died.Often in summer, drinking from the spring,I sensed in its cool breath and in its voiceA living form, darker than any shadeAnd without feature, passionate, yet chillWith lust to fix in ice the buoyant rim\u2014Ancient of days, the mother of us all.Now, toward his destined passion there, the strong,Vivid young man, reluctant, may returnFrom suffering in his own experienceTo lie down in the darkness. In this time,I stay in doors. I do my work. I sleep.Each morning, when I wake, I assent to wake.The shadow of my fist moves on this page,Though, even now, in the wood, beneath a bank,Coiled in the leaves and cooling rocks, the snakeDoes as it must, and sinks into the cold.2Nights grow colder. The Hunter and the BearFollow their tranquil course outside my window.I feel the gentian waiting in the wood,Blossoms waxy and blue, and blue-green stemsOf the amaryllis waiting in the garden.I know, as though I waited what they wait,The cold that fastens ice about the root,A heavenly form, the same in all its changes,Inimitable, terrible, and still,And beautiful as frost. Fire warms my room.Its light declares my books and pictures. Gently,A dead soprano sings Mozart and Bach.I drink bourbon, then go to bed, and sleepIn the Promethean heat of summer\u2019s essence.3Awakened by some fear, I watch the sky.Compelled as though by purposes they know,The stars, in their blue distance, still affirmThe bond of heaven and earth, the ancient way.This old assurance haunts small creatures, dazedIn icy mud, though cold may freeze them thereAnd leave them as they are all summer long.I cannot sleep. Passion and consequence,The brutal given, and all I have desiredEvade me, and the lucid majestyThat warmed the dull barbarian to life.So I lie here, left with self-consciousness,Enemy whom I love but whom his changeAnd his forgetfulness again compel,Impassioned, toward my lost indifference,Faithful, but to an absence. Who shares my bed?Who lies beside me, certain of his waking,Led sleeping, by his own dream, to the day?4If I ask you, angel, will you come and leadThis ache to speech, or carry me, like a child,To riot? Ever young, you come of ageRemote, a pledge of distances, this pangI notice at dusk, watching you subsideFrom tree-tops and from fields. Mysterious self,Image of the fabulous alien,Even in sleep you summon me, even there,When, under his native tree, Odysseus hearsHis own incredible past and future, whisperedBy wisdom, but by wisdom in disguise.5Thinking of a bravura deed, a placeSacred to a divinity, an oldVerse that seems new, I postulate a manMastered by his own image of himself.Who is it says, I am? Sensuous angel,Vessel of nerve and blood, the impoverished heirOf an awareness other than his own?Not these, but one to come? For there he is,In a steel helmet, raging, fearing his death,Carrying bread and water to a quiet,Placing ten sounds together in one sound:Confirming his election, or merely still,Sleeping, or in a colloquy with the sun.6Snow and then rain. The roads are wet. A carSlips and strains in the mire, and I rememberDriving in France: weapons-carriers and jeeps;Our clothes and bodies stiffened by mud; our mindsDiverted from fear. We labor. Overhead,A plane, Berlin or Frankfurt, now New York.The car pulls clear. My neighbor smiles. He is old.Was this our wisdom, simply, in a chance,In danger, to be mastered by a task,Like groping round a chair, through a door, to bed?7A dormant season, and, under the dripping tree,Not sovereign, ordering nothing, letting the pastDo with me as it will, I savor placeAnd weather, air and sun. Though HerculesConfronts his nature in his deed, repeatsHis purposes, and is his will, intact,Magnificent, and memorable, I tryThe simplest forms of our old poverty.I seek no end appointed in my absenceBeyond the silence I already share.8I drive home with the books that I will read.The streets are harsh with traffic. Where I oncePlayed as a boy amid old stands of pine,Row after row of houses. Lined by the newDebris of wealth and power, the broken road.Then miles of red clay bank and frugal ground.At last, in the minor hills, my father\u2019s place,Where I can find my way as in a thought\u2014Gardens, the trees we planted, all we share.A Cherokee trail runs north to summer hunting.I see it, when I look up from the page.9In nameless warmth, sun light in every corner,Bending my body over my glowing book,I share the room. Is it with a voice or touchOr look, as of an absence, learned by love,Now, merely mine? Annunciation, specterOf the worn out, lost, or broken, telling what future.What vivid loss to come, you change the roomAnd him who reads here. Restless, he will stir,Look round, and see the room renewed and line,Color, and shape as, in desire, they are,Not shadows but substantial light, explicit,Bright as glass, inexhaustible, and true.1OMy shadow moves, until, at noon, I standWithin its seal, as in the finished past.But in the place where effect and cause are joined,In the warmth or cold of my remembering,Of love, of partial freedom, the time to beTrembles and glitters again in windy light.For nothing is disposed. The slow soft windTilting the blood-root keeps its gentle edge.The intimate cry, both sinister and tender,Once heard, is heard confined in its reserve.My image of myself, apart, informedBy many deaths, resists me, and I stayAlmost as I have been, intact, aware,Alive, though proud and cautious, even afraid.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "The Man Who Drowned in the Irrigation Ditch She always got mad at himevery time he came home in the middle of the morningwith his pant legs wet.She knew he had fallen in the ditch again.His legs were not strong enough to be straddling ditches.He was too old to be walking over temporary dikes.She wished he didn\u2019t do that, but sometimes he had to.She sometimes imagined him falling over backward in one of the irrigation ditches,his head hitting hard cement,his body slowly sinking into the water.Water that was only three feet deep.A harmless three feet of water,where children played,and ladies sometimes sat and dipped their feet,especially on hot summer evening.She knew he would drown,she knew it was bound to happen sometime.As far as the eye could see,flat, green fields appearing to end at the foot of distant mountains.Mountains, a reminder of what the fields once looked like.Fields saturated with water pulled from its secret storage placebeneath the earth\u2019s surface.We are called \u201cthe people of the cotton fields\u201dbecause of the labor our families did.For us there was no reservation, no Housing & Urban Development, no tribal support.We were a people segregated in row housesall lined up along the roads of our labor.It is a muggy summer evening.My father, my sister, and I sit on the east side of the house finding shade against the still-hot setting sun.The change from brilliant white sun to blue and gold sunset and finally,to warm darkness, a change we anticipate for brief relief.On this evening the anticipation is shattered.A boy comes to the house. He gestures for my father to come to him, out of our hearing.With what the boy says to him my father moves quickly.As quickly as his stiff back and legs can move him.Back and legs broken and fused from when he was a cowboy.He rushes by, throwing the kitchen door open, grabbing his hat.He gets into his truck and drives away.We pay him no mind other than for the fact that he is rushing.A second later my mother comes out of the house and with a single motion pulls her apron off.In a tone I recognize as signifying something is wrong, she instructs us to come with her.She starts in the direction of a cotton field a few hundred yards from our house.My sister and I walk beside her.Saying nothing.Her hands wring the towel she carries with her.This towel, a multipurpose kind of thing.Women carry it to fan themselves,to wipe sweat, to cover their heads and eyes from the sunlight, to shoo away kids, dogs, flies.I remember once a student of mine, out of habit, brought her towel with her to summer school at the university.Whenever we see each other on campus during a summer session we always laugh about it.We continue to walk, stepping over the ends of rows of cotton.Rows of cotton my family and I know well.In early summer we walk the rows to thin out the growth,and later we walk to chop the weeds somehow immune to chemicals.And in the winter, at least before the machinery, we pick the cotton from their stalks.Now I can\u2019t begin to imagine how many miles we have all walked,up and back, up and back along these rows.We walk alongside her.The setting sun maintains a continuous pounding on our backs,the humidity from the damp fields is warm, it rests on our shoulders like tired, sweaty arms.She heads toward the irrigation ditch.The ditch is dirt, not cement, it is wide, muddy, and slippery.The water is shallow.I see my father\u2019s truck pulling up on the opposite side.In the front seat there are women, and in the back, men.The men wedge their feet in between plastic and aluminum irrigation pipes, mud-caked shovels, boots, and hoes.Equipment in the back of his truck all for the purposes of working fields.I remember the hoe he carried.It was big, with a blade that held an edge well and got the work done.I recall purchasing a hoe for my home and being particularly unsatisfied with the craftsmanship.\u201cThey call this a hoe?\u201d I said to my husband. It had a skinny neck, and no blade to speak of.The handle was too thin, causing blisters.Once in awhile I look around for the type of hoe my father carried. I found one once, but didn\u2019t have money to buy it.In slow motion,weighed down by the heat,the women begin to slide across the bench of the pickup truck.They slowly step out of the cab, appearing as a single long strand of woman, emerging.In cautious unison they walk toward the edge of the ditch.My mother, as if connected to them by an invisible string,is pulled toward them from the opposite side.Their movement is dreamlike. They peer into the muddy water.And as if with a shared nervous system, their hands motion the towel each is carrying,motion it to just above their eyes, covering their faces.With a single vocal act they release from their depths a hard, deep, mournful wail.This sound breaks the wave of bright summer light above the green cotton fields.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "A Forsaken Garden In a coign of the cliff between lowland and highland,        At the sea-down's edge between windward and lee, Walled round with rocks as an inland island,        The ghost of a garden fronts the sea. A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses        The steep square slope of the blossomless bed Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses                Now lie dead. The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,        To the low last edge of the long lone land. If a step should sound or a word be spoken,        Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand? So long have the grey bare walks lain guestless,        Through branches and briars if a man make way, He shall find no life but the sea-wind's, restless                Night and day. The dense hard passage is blind and stifled        That crawls by a track none turn to climb To the strait waste place that the years have rifled        Of all but the thorns that are touched not of time. The thorns he spares when the rose is taken;        The rocks are left when he wastes the plain. The wind that wanders, the weeds wind-shaken,                These remain. Not a flower to be pressed of the foot that falls not;        As the heart of a dead man the seed-plots are dry; From the thicket of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,        Could she call, there were never a rose to reply. Over the meadows that blossom and wither        Rings but the note of a sea-bird's song; Only the sun and the rain come hither                All year long. The sun burns sere and the rain dishevels        One gaunt bleak blossom of scentless breath. Only the wind here hovers and revels        In a round where life seems barren as death. Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,        Haply, of lovers none ever will know, Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping                Years ago. Heart handfast in heart as they stood, \"Look thither,\"        Did he whisper? \"look forth from the flowers to the sea; For the foam-flowers endure when the rose-blossoms wither,        And men that love lightly may die\u2014but we?\" And the same wind sang and the same waves whitened,        And or ever the garden's last petals were shed, In the lips that had whispered, the eyes that had lightened,                Love was dead. Or they loved their life through, and then went whither?        And were one to the end\u2014but what end who knows? Love deep as the sea as a rose must wither,        As the rose-red seaweed that mocks the rose. Shall the dead take thought for the dead to love them?        What love was ever as deep as a grave? They are loveless now as the grass above them                Or the wave. All are at one now, roses and lovers,        Not known of the cliffs and the fields and the sea. Not a breath of the time that has been hovers        In the air now soft with a summer to be. Not a breath shall there sweeten the seasons hereafter        Of the flowers or the lovers that laugh now or weep, When as they that are free now of weeping and laughter                We shall sleep. Here death may deal not again for ever;        Here change may come not till all change end. From the graves they have made they shall rise up never,        Who have left nought living to ravage and rend. Earth, stones, and thorns of the wild ground growing,        While the sun and the rain live, these shall be; Till a last wind's breath upon all these blowing                Roll the sea. Till the slow sea rise and the sheer cliff crumble,        Till terrace and meadow the deep gulfs drink, Till the strength of the waves of the high tides humble        The fields that lessen, the rocks that shrink, Here now in his triumph where all things falter,        Stretched out on the spoils that his own hand spread, As a god self-slain on his own strange altar,                Death lies dead.", "Label": "human"}

They went to her tongue and asked why silence imprisoned the words of the child, why lumps were present under her chin, why tears drew channels down her cheeks.I asked my grandmother how her tongue replied. After touching my cheek, she told me she had a dream that night: She was within her lungs and she rose like breath through the moist of her throat. She remembered her tonsils swinging before her like fleshy apples, then a hand taking them into a fist, harvesting their sound. She told me her throat opened in two spots like insect eyes and the names of her children came flying through her wounds like peacocks.Patting my thigh, she said, \"That is why the name of your mother is Maria, because she is a prayer, a song of praise to the Holy Mother.\" She told me this, then showed me two scars on her throat\u2014tiny scars, like two eyelids stitched closed.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "Mutter There is a brand of play called mutenessBeneath the play yard\u2019s interlacing branches. It appeals to children born Entre deux guerres, whose specialty it is.    It is mutiny; that is, a tongue  Of foreign origin ending in grunts.  One such child uses his tongueOn a frozen fence for the embrace of it For the mutating appendage makes of speech A combat; an internment. There is a brand of child assisted to the play yardBy his keeper fussing with his zipper.   Yes, it is cold in the high hemisphereAnd nothing will be the death of him As he sets hard sweets on his tongue He neither chews nor swallows.  Such children can never swing too freely  From the elm\u2019s loping barkless arm.  It is mutual.

By August, there are berries.A six-pack of Grain Belt beer is ninety-nine cents.Friends have a ranch with acres that stretch back throughbottomland to their mountain pasture.

Her not being glad lasts half an hour.She\u2019ll work for the library until she\u2019s due in June.The baby does its tours inside her. When we put the bigheadphones on her tummy, it seems to hear.Her doctor tells her to cut down on salt, herblood pressure\u2019s high. We buy a stethoscope and cuff.She tells Linda to quit her job and go to bed.The salt-free cottage cheese is cardboard, but it\u2019snot working, nothing is, I can wait until she\u2019s beenresting for an hour before I take it, it doesn\u2019t help.Since her diastolic number\u2019s always high, it\u2019s ofcourse high when she sees the doctor: she\u2019ll be in thehospital tomorrow morning if we don\u2019t changedoctors tonight. La Leche League has two it recommends.The one who calls back asks everything. If she werehis wife, he says, he\u2019d want her in the hospital.We\u2019re too frightened to sleep. I hold her. I fall offonly when it\u2019s almost light and by then thebirds have started. It makes her cry to hear them.When she\u2019s admitted to the ward, they hook anIV up to her that hurts her hand. On the vacant bednext to her, there\u2019s a tray with a syringe and drugs:if she goes into labor she might have convulsions.They tell us on Monday that the baby wouldn\u2019t be able tobreathe yet on its own, on Wednesday that it couldsuffocate inside her, her placenta\u2019s shutting down.They\u2019ll do another amniocentesis in the morning,they\u2019ll take the baby in the afternoon. She and I are suchcases by now that I think they\u2019ll lie, they\u2019ll want toquiet us for the birth by telling us the baby\u2019s lungsare ready, that stranger things have happened in three days.A nurse comes in and says the baby\u2019s lungs are ready,let\u2019s go to prep. Since Linda can\u2019t have itnaturally, it matters all the more to her that she atleast be awake. She\u2019ll get to be.

Everyone\u2019s in greens.Down a corridor, away from me so I won\u2019t hear,the anesthesiologist is talking to her doctors,who are very intent. The scene breaks up.

Stop it, you can\u2019t let hersee you like this, her pediatrician says.She\u2019s partly sedated. I tell her I\u2019ll be waitingright down the hall. From another room than hers, ababy, a first cry. I have to hear it or not listen too forour baby, Linda\u2019s asleep, she can\u2019t. If it\u2019s fromher room now that I\u2019m hearing something fainter,someone should tell me soon.

Almost a month early, he\u2019s awonder to the staff at five pounds ten, he\u2019s Linda\u2019s doing,she should be proud of him, she\u2019ll nurse him and she\u2019ll heal.I can buy her now the blue- and white-checked ginghammother and baby rabbit. I can buy her a robe. He comeshome with her after the weekend. The two of them feel sohallowed to me that I\u2019m slow to tell it hasn\u2019t workedout for her at all. She writes an essay about it.His having been taken from her early means she failed.Bodies are bodies. They know things, they have their own ways.She could have done it if she\u2019d gotten the chance. Her doctordidn\u2019t want Linda caring how things went. That had to beher job, not Linda\u2019s. She\u2019d gone on to say it almostproudly of Linda at the last:      \u201cThis little girl would be fine if she didn\u2019t have a brain.\u201dIt\u2019s a long essay. I recognize everything but me.Not her antagonist, exactly, I\u2019d been anotherthing she\u2019d had to worry.

{"Poem": "A Sequence of Sonnets on the Death of Robert Browning I The clearest eyes in all the world they read        With sense more keen and spirit of sight more true        Than burns and thrills in sunrise, when the dew Flames, and absorbs the glory round it shed, As they the light of ages quick and dead,        Closed now, forsake us: yet the shaft that slew        Can slay not one of all the works we knew, Nor death discrown that many-laurelled head. The works of words whose life seems lightning wrought, And moulded of unconquerable thought,        And quickened with imperishable flame, Stand fast and shine and smile, assured that nought        May fade of all their myriad-moulded fame,        Nor England's memory clasp not Browning's name. II Death, what hast thou to do with one for whom        Time is not lord, but servant? What least part        Of all the fire that fed his living heart, Of all the light more keen that sundawn's bloom That lit and led his spirit, strong as doom        And bright as hope, can aught thy breath may dart        Quench? Nay, thou knowest he knew thee what thou art, A shadow born of terror's barren womb, That brings not forth save shadows. What art thou, To dream, albeit thou breathe upon his brow,        That power on him is given thee,\u2014that thy breath Can make him less than love acclaims him now,        And hears all time sound back the word it saith?        What part hast thou then in his glory, Death? III A graceless doom it seems that bids us grieve:        Venice and winter, hand in deadly hand,        Have slain the lover of her sunbright strand And singer of a stormbright Christmas Eve. A graceless guerdon we that loved receive        For all our love, from that the dearest land        Love worshipped ever. Blithe and soft and bland, Too fair for storm to scathe or fire to cleave, Shone on our dreams and memories evermore The domes, the towers, the mountains and the shore        That gird or guard thee, Venice: cold and black Seems now the face we loved as he of yore.        We have given thee love\u2014no stint, no stay, no lack:        What gift, what gift is this thou hast given us back? IV But he\u2014to him, who knows what gift is thine,        Death? Hardly may we think or hope, when we        Pass likewise thither where to-night is he, Beyond the irremeable outer seas that shine And darken round such dreams as half divine        Some sunlit harbour in that starless sea        Where gleams no ship to windward or to lee, To read with him the secret of thy shrine. There too, as here, may song, delight, and love, The nightingale, the sea-bird, and the dove,        Fulfil with joy the splendour of the sky Till all beneath wax bright as all above:        But none of all that search the heavens, and try        The sun, may match the sovereign eagle's eye. V Among the wondrous ways of men and time        He went as one that ever found and sought        And bore in hand the lamp-like spirit of thought To illume with instance of its fire sublime The dusk of many a cloudlike age and clime.        No spirit in shape of light and darkness wrought,        No faith, no fear, no dream, no rapture, nought That blooms in wisdom, nought that burns in crime, No virtue girt and armed and helmed with light, No love more lovely than the snows are white,        No serpent sleeping in some dead soul's tomb, No song-bird singing from some live soul's height,        But he might hear, interpret, or illume        With sense invasive as the dawn of doom. VI What secret thing of splendour or of shade        Surmised in all those wandering ways wherein        Man, led of love and life and death and sin, Strays, climbs, or cowers, allured, absorbed, afraid, Might not the strong and sunlike sense invade        Of that full soul that had for aim to win        Light, silent over time's dark toil and din, Life, at whose touch death fades as dead things fade? O spirit of man, what mystery moves in thee That he might know not of in spirit, and see        The heart within the heart that seems to strive, The life within the life that seems to be,        And hear, through all thy storms that whirl and drive,        The living sound of all men's souls alive? VII He held no dream worth waking: so he said,        He who stands now on death's triumphal steep,        Awakened out of life wherein we sleep And dream of what he knows and sees, being dead. But never death for him was dark or dread:        \"Look forth\" he bade the soul, and fear not. Weep,        All ye that trust not in his truth, and keep Vain memory's vision of a vanished head As all that lives of all that once was he Save that which lightens from his word: but we,        Who, seeing the sunset-coloured waters roll, Yet know the sun subdued not of the sea,        Nor weep nor doubt that still the spirit is whole,        And life and death but shadows of the soul.", "Label": "human"}

Now a month\u2019s supply of pills came in a hard blue case with a handle. You opened it & found the usual vial plus six tiny ponies of assorted shapes & sizes, softly breathing in the Styrofoam. Often they had to be pried out & would wobble a little when first put on the ground. In the beginning the children tried to play with them, but the sharp hooves nicked their fingers & the ponies refused to jump over pencil hurdles. The children stopped feeding them sugarwater & the ponies were left to break their legs on the gardens\u2019 gravel paths or drown in the gutters. On the first day of the month, rats gathered on doorsteps & spat out only the bitter manes. Many a pony\u2019s last sight was a bounding squirrel with its tail hovering over its head like a halo. Behind the movie theatre the hardier ponies gathered in packs amongst the cigarette butts, getting their hooves stuck in wads of gum. They lined the hills at funerals, huddled under folding chairs at weddings. It became a matter of pride if one of your ponies proved unusually sturdy. People would smile & say, \u201cThis would have been an awful month for me,\u201d pointing to the glossy palomino trotting energetically around their ankles.

{"Poem": "The Building of the Ship \"Build me straight, O worthy Master! Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel, That shall laugh at all disaster, And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!\" The merchant's word Delighted the Master heard; For his heart was in his work, and the heart Giveth grace unto every Art. A quiet smile played round his lips, As the eddies and dimples of the tide Play round the bows of ships, That steadily at anchor ride. And with a voice that was full of glee, He answered, \"Erelong we will launch A vessel as goodly, and strong, and stanch, As ever weathered a wintry sea!\" And first with nicest skill and art, Perfect and finished in every part, A little model the Master wrought, Which should be to the larger plan What the child is to the man, Its counterpart in miniature; That with a hand more swift and sure The greater labor might be brought To answer to his inward thought. And as he labored, his mind ran o'er The various ships that were built of yore, And above them all, and strangest of all Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall, Whose picture was hanging on the wall, With bows and stern raised high in air, And balconies hanging here and there, And signal lanterns and flags afloat, And eight round towers, like those that frown From some old castle, looking down Upon the drawbridge and the moat. And he said with a smile, \"Our ship, I wis, Shall be of another form than this!\" It was of another form, indeed; Built for freight, and yet for speed, A beautiful and gallant craft; Broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast, Pressing down upon sail and mast, Might not the sharp bows overwhelm; Broad in the beam, but sloping aft With graceful curve and slow degrees, That she might be docile to the helm, And that the currents of parted seas, Closing behind, with mighty force, Might aid and not impede her course. In the ship-yard stood the Master, With the model of the vessel, That should laugh at all disaster, And with wave and whirlwind wrestle! Covering many a rood of ground, Lay the timber piled around; Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak, And scattered here and there, with these, The knarred and crooked cedar knees; Brought from regions far away, From Pascagoula's sunny bay, And the banks of the roaring Roanoke! Ah! what a wondrous thing it is To note how many wheels of toil One thought, one word, can set in motion! There 's not a ship that sails the ocean, But every climate, every soil, Must bring its tribute, great or small, And help to build the wooden wall! The sun was rising o'er the sea, And long the level shadows lay, As if they, too, the beams would be Of some great, airy argosy, Framed and launched in a single day. That silent architect, the sun, Had hewn and laid them every one, Ere the work of man was yet begun. Beside the Master, when he spoke, A youth, against an anchor leaning, Listened, to catch his slightest meaning. Only the long waves, as they broke In ripples on the pebbly beach, Interrupted the old man's speech. Beautiful they were, in sooth, The old man and the fiery youth! The old man, in whose busy brain Many a ship that sailed the main Was modelled o'er and o'er again; \u2014 The fiery youth, who was to be The heir of his dexterity, The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand, When he had built and launched from land What the elder head had planned. \"Thus,\" said he, \"will we build this ship! Lay square the blocks upon the slip, And follow well this plan of mine. Choose the timbers with greatest care; Of all that is unsound beware; For only what is sound and strong To this vessel shall belong. Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine Here together shall combine. A goodly frame, and a goodly fame, And the Union be her name! For the day that gives her to the sea Shall give my daughter unto thee!\" The Master's word Enraptured the young man heard; And as he turned his face aside, With a look of joy and a thrill of pride Standing before Her father's door, He saw the form of his promised bride. The sun shone on her golden hair, And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair, With the breath of morn and the soft sea air. Like a beauteous barge was she, Still at rest on the sandy beach, Just beyond the billow's reach; But he Was the restless, seething, stormy sea! Ah, how skilful grows the hand That obeyeth Love's command! It is the heart, and not the brain, That to the highest doth attain, And he who followeth Love's behest Far excelleth all the rest! Thus with the rising of the sun Was the noble task begun, And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds Were heard the intermingled sounds Of axes and of mallets, plied With vigorous arms on every side; Plied so deftly and so well, That, ere the shadows of evening fell, The keel of oak for a noble ship, Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong, Was lying ready, and stretched along The blocks, well placed upon the slip. Happy, thrice happy, every one Who sees his labor well begun, And not perplexed and multiplied, By idly waiting for time and tide! And when the hot, long day was o'er, The young man at the Master's door Sat with the maiden calm and still, And within the porch, a little more Removed beyond the evening chill, The father sat, and told them tales Of wrecks in the great September gales, Of pirates coasting the Spanish Main, And ships that never came back again, The chance and change of a sailor's life, Want and plenty, rest and strife, His roving fancy, like the wind, That nothing can stay and nothing can bind, And the magic charm of foreign lands, With shadows of palms, and shining sands, Where the tumbling surf, O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar, Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar, As he lies alone and asleep on the turf. And the trembling maiden held her breath At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea, With all its terror and mystery, The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death, That divides and yet unites mankind! And whenever the old man paused, a gleam From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume The silent group in the twilight gloom, And thoughtful faces, as in a dream; And for a moment one might mark What had been hidden by the dark, That the head of the maiden lay at rest, Tenderly, on the young man's breast! Day by day the vessel grew, With timbers fashioned strong and true, Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee, Till, framed with perfect symmetry, A skeleton ship rose up to view! And around the bows and along the side The heavy hammers and mallets plied, Till after many a week, at length, Wonderful for form and strength, Sublime in its enormous bulk, Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk! And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing, Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething Caldron, that glowed, And overflowed With the black tar, heated for the sheathing. And amid the clamors Of clattering hammers, He who listened heard now and then The song of the Master and his men: \u2014 \"Build me straight, O worthy Master,       Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel, That shall laugh at all disaster,       And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!\" With oaken brace and copper band, Lay the rudder on the sand, That, like a thought, should have control Over the movement of the whole; And near it the anchor, whose giant hand Would reach down and grapple with the land, And immovable and fast Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast! And at the bows an image stood, By a cunning artist carved in wood, With robes of white, that far behind Seemed to be fluttering in the wind. It was not shaped in a classic mould, Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old, Or Naiad rising from the water, But modelled from the Master's daughter! On many a dreary and misty night, 'T will be seen by the rays of the signal light, Speeding along through the rain and the dark, Like a ghost in its snow-white sark, The pilot of some phantom bark, Guiding the vessel, in its flight, By a path none other knows aright! Behold, at last, Each tall and tapering mast Is swung into its place; Shrouds and stays Holding it firm and fast! Long ago, In the deer-haunted forests of Maine, When upon mountain and plain Lay the snow, They fell, \u2014 those lordly pines! Those grand, majestic pines! 'Mid shouts and cheers The jaded steers, Panting beneath the goad, Dragged down the weary, winding road Those captive kings so straight and tall, To be shorn of their streaming hair, And naked and bare, To feel the stress and the strain Of the wind and the reeling main, Whose roar Would remind them forevermore Of their native forests they should not see again. And everywhere The slender, graceful spars Poise aloft in the air, And at the mast-head, White, blue, and red, A flag unrolls the stripes and stars. Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless, In foreign harbors shall behold That flag unrolled, 'T will be as a friendly hand Stretched out from his native land, Filling his heart with memories sweet and endless! All is finished! and at length Has come the bridal day Of beauty and of strength. To-day the vessel shall be launched! With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched, And o'er the bay, Slowly, in all his splendors dight, The great sun rises to behold the sight. The ocean old, Centuries old, Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled, Paces restless to and fro, Up and down the sands of gold. His beating heart is not at rest; And far and wide, With ceaseless flow, His beard of snow Heaves with the heaving of his breast. He waits impatient for his bride. There she stands, With her foot upon the sands, Decked with flags and streamers gay, In honor of her marriage day, Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending, Round her like a veil descending, Ready to be The bride of the gray old sea. On the deck another bride Is standing by her lover's side. Shadows from the flags and shrouds, Like the shadows cast by clouds, Broken by many a sunny fleck, Fall around them on the deck. The prayer is said, The service read, The joyous bridegroom bows his head; And in tears the good old Master Shakes the brown hand of his son, Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek In silence, for he cannot speak, And ever faster Down his own the tears begin to run. The worthy pastor \u2014 The shepherd of that wandering flock, That has the ocean for its wold, That has the vessel for its fold, Leaping ever from rock to rock \u2014 Spake, with accents mild and clear, Words of warning, words of cheer, But tedious to the bridegroom's ear. He knew the chart Of the sailor's heart, All its pleasures and its griefs, All its shallows and rocky reefs, All those secret currents, that flow With such resistless undertow, And lift and drift, with terrible force, The will from its moorings and its course. Therefore he spake, and thus said he: \u2014 \"Like unto ships far off at sea, Outward or homeward bound, are we. Before, behind, and all around, Floats and swings the horizon's bound, Seems at its distant rim to rise And climb the crystal wall of the skies, And then again to turn and sink, As if we could slide from its outer brink. Ah! it is not the sea, It is not the sea that sinks and shelves, But ourselves That rock and rise With endless and uneasy motion, Now touching the very skies, Now sinking into the depths of ocean. Ah! if our souls but poise and swing Like the compass in its brazen ring, Ever level and ever true To the toil and the task we have to do, We shall sail securely, and safely reach The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining beach The sights we see, and the sounds we hear, Will be those of joy and not of fear!\" Then the Master, With a gesture of command, Waved his hand; And at the word, Loud and sudden there was heard, All around them and below, The sound of hammers, blow on blow, Knocking away the shores and spurs. And see! she stirs! She starts, \u2014 she moves, \u2014 she seems to feel The thrill of life along her keel, And, spurning with her foot the ground, With one exulting, joyous bound, She leaps into the ocean's arms! And lo! from the assembled crowd There rose a shout, prolonged and loud, That to the ocean seemed to say, \"Take her, O bridegroom, old and gray, Take her to thy protecting arms, With all her youth and all her charms!\" How beautiful she is! How fair She lies within those arms, that press Her form with many a soft caress Of tenderness and watchful care! Sail forth into the sea, O ship! Through wind and wave, right onward steer! The moistened eye, the trembling lip, Are not the signs of doubt or fear. Sail forth into the sea of life, O gentle, loving, trusting wife, And safe from all adversity Upon the bosom of that sea Thy comings and thy goings be! For gentleness and love and trust Prevail o'er angry wave and gust; And in the wreck of noble lives Something immortal still survives! Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State! Sail on, O Union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate! We know what Master laid thy keel, What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel, Who made each mast, and sail, and rope, What anvils rang, what hammers beat, In what a forge and what a heat Were shaped the anchors of thy hope! Fear not each sudden sound and shock, 'T is of the wave and not the rock; 'T is but the flapping of the sail, And not a rent made by the gale! In spite of rock and tempest's roar, In spite of false lights on the shore, Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea! Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee, Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears, Our faith triumphant o'er our fears, Are all with thee, \u2014 are all with thee!", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "Morte d'Arthur So all day long the noise of battle roll'd Among the mountains by the winter sea; Until King Arthur's table, man by man, Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their Lord, King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep, The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him, Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights, And bore him to a chapel nigh the field, A broken chancel with a broken cross, That stood on a dark strait of barren land. On one side lay the ocean, and on one Lay a great water, and the moon was full.          Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: \"The sequel of to-day unsolders all The goodliest fellowship of famous knights Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep They sleep\u2014the men I loved. I think that we Shall never more, at any future time, Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds, Walking about the gardens and the halls Of Camelot, as in the days that were. I perish by this people which I made,\u2014 Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again To rule once more\u2014but let what will be, be, I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm That without help I cannot last till morn. Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur, Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how In those old days, one summer noon, an arm Rose up from out the bosom of the lake, Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, Holding the sword\u2014and how I row'd across And took it, and have worn it, like a king: And, wheresoever I am sung or told In aftertime, this also shall be known: But now delay not: take Excalibur, And fling him far into the middle mere: Watch what thou se\u00ebst, and lightly bring me word.\"          To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere: \"It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus, Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm. A little thing may harm a wounded man. Yet I thy hest will all perform at full, Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.\"          So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept And in the moon athwart the place of tombs, Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men, Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock, Came on the shining levels of the lake.          There drew he forth the brand Excalibur, And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon, Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt: For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth work Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood, This way and that dividing the swift mind, In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd There in the many-knotted water-flags, That whistled stiff and dry about the marge. So strode he back slow to the wounded King.          Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere: \"Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave? What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?\"          And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: \"I heard the ripple washing in the reeds, And the wild water lapping on the crag.\"          To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale: \"Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name, Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight: For surer sign had follow'd, either hand, Or voice, or else a motion of the mere. This is a shameful thing for men to lie. Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.\"          Then went Sir Bedivere the second time Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought; But when he saw the wonder of the hilt, How curiously and strangely chased, he smote His palms together, and he cried aloud,          \"And if indeed I cast the brand away, Surely a precious thing, one worthy note, Should thus be lost forever from the earth, Which might have pleased the eyes of many men. What good should follow this, if this were done? What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey, Seeing obedience is the bond of rule. Were it well to obey then, if a king demand An act unprofitable, against himself? The King is sick, and knows not what he does. What record, or what relic of my lord Should be to aftertime, but empty breath And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept, Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings, Some one might show it at a joust of arms, Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur, Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake; Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps Upon the hidden bases of the hills.' So might some old man speak in the aftertime To all the people, winning reverence. But now much honour and much fame were lost.\"          So spake he, clouded with his own conceit, And hid Excalibur the second time, And so strode back slow to the wounded King.          Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily: \"What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard?\"          And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: \"I heard the water lapping on the crag, And the long ripple washing in the reeds.\"          To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath: \"Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me! Authority forgets a dying king, Laid widow'd of the power in his eye That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art, For thou, the latest-left of all my knights, In whom should meet the offices of all, Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt; Either from lust of gold, or like a girl Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes. Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice, And the third time may prosper, get thee hence: But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur, I will arise and slay thee with my hands.\"          Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword, And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon, And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch, Shot like a streamer of the northern morn, Seen where the moving isles of winter shock By night, with noises of the northern sea. So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur: But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him Three times, and drew him under in the mere. And lightly went the other to the King.          Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath: \"Now see I by thine eyes that this is done. Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?\"          And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere: \"Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems Should blind my purpose, for I never saw, Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die, Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men, So great a miracle as yonder hilt. Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him; But when I look'd again, behold an arm, Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful, That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him Three times, and drew him under in the mere.\"          And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard: \"My end draws nigh; 't is time that I were gone. Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight, And bear me to the margin; yet I fear My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.\"          So saying, from the pavement he half rose, Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm, And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears, And would have spoken, but he found not words, Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee, O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands, And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.          But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard, Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King Muttering and murmuring at his ear, \"Quick, quick! I fear it is too late, and I shall die.\" But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge, Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd Larger than human on the frozen hills. He heard the deep behind him, and a cry Before. His own thought drove him like a goad. Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves And barren chasms, and all to left and right The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels\u2014 And on a sudden, lo! the level lake, And the long glories of the winter moon.          Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern, Beneath them; and descending they were ware That all the decks were dense with stately forms Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream\u2014by these Three Queens with crowns of gold\u2014and from them rose A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars, And, as it were one voice, an agony Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills All night in a waste land, where no one comes, Or hath come, since the making of the world.          Then murmur'd Arthur, \"Place me in the barge,\" And to the barge they came. There those three Queens Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept. But she that rose the tallest of them all And fairest, laid his head upon her lap, And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands, And call'd him by his name, complaining loud And dropping bitter tears against his brow Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white And colourless, and like the wither'd moon Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east; And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls\u2014 That made his forehead like a rising sun High from the da\u00efs-throne\u2014were parch'd with dust; Or, clotted into points and hanging loose, Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips. So like a shatter'd column lay the King; Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest, From spur to plume a star of tournament, Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.          Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere: \"Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go? Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes? For now I see the true old times are dead, When every morning brought a noble chance, And every chance brought out a noble knight. Such times have been not since the light that led The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh. But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved Which was an image of the mighty world; And I, the last, go forth companionless, And the days darken round me, and the years, Among new men, strange faces, other minds.\"          And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge: \"The old order changeth, yielding place to new, And God fulfils Himself in many ways, Lest one good custom should corrupt the world. Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me? I have lived my life, and that which I have done May He within Himself make pure! but thou, If thou shouldst never see my face again, Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice Rise like a fountain for me night and day. For what are men better than sheep or goats That nourish a blind life within the brain, If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer Both for themselves and those who call them friend? For so the whole round earth is every way Bound by gold chains about the feet of God. But now farewell. I am going a long way With these thou se\u00ebst\u2014if indeed I go\u2014 (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt) To the island-valley of Avilion; Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow, Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.\"          So said he, and the barge with oar and sail Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan That, fluting a wild carol ere her death, Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere Revolving many memories, till the hull Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn, And on the mere the wailing died away.", "Label": "human"}

{"Poem": "Sestina of the Lady Pietra degli Scrovigni To the dim light and the large circle of shade I have clomb, and to the whitening of the hills, There where we see no color in the grass. Natheless my longing loses not its green, It has so taken root in the hard stone Which talks and hears as though it were a lady. Utterly frozen is this youthful lady, Even as the snow that lies within the shade; For she is no more moved than is the stone By the sweet season which makes warm the hills And alters them afresh from white to green Covering their sides again with flowers and grass. When on her hair she sets a crown of grass The thought has no more room for other lady, Because she weaves the yellow with the green So well that Love sits down there in the shade,\u2013 Love who has shut me in among low hills Faster than between walls of granite-stone. She is more bright than is a precious stone; The wound she gives may not be healed with grass: I therefore have fled far o\u2019er plains and hills For refuge from so dangerous a lady; But from her sunshine nothing can give shade,\u2013 Not any hill, nor wall, nor summer-green. A while ago, I saw her dressed in green,\u2013 So fair, she might have wakened in a stone This love which I do feel even for her shade; And therefore, as one woos a graceful lady, I wooed her in a field that was all grass Girdled about with very lofty hills. Yet shall the streams turn back and climb the hills Before Love\u2019s flame in this damp wood and green Burn, as it burns within a youthful lady, For my sake, who would sleep away in stone My life, or feed like beasts upon the grass, Only to see her garments cast a shade.
