"The streets are dark and silent now
As I sit here with the case before me
A mystery that has been unfolding slow
Like a flower blooming in the dead of night

The letter came to me a week ago
A cryptic message from an unknown sender
A riddle wrapped in mystery and fear
A challenge to unravel, to uncover the thread

The words were few, but the meaning clear
A crime had been committed, and the culprit drawn near
A trail of clues left, like breadcrumbs in the snow
Leading me deeper into the darkness, where the truth would grow

I followed the trail, through alleys and streets
Through shadows cast by flickering streetlights' gleams
I interviewed the witnesses, each with their tale
A patchwork quilt of stories, with threads that would not fail

The victim's name was whispered, in hushed tones and awe
A young woman, with a life that was just beginning to unfurl
Her laughter echoed still, in the silence of the night
As I searched for answers, with all my might

The letter led me to a warehouse, abandoned and gray
Where the scent of smoke and desperation hung in the air
A hidden room, with walls that seemed to close in
Where the truth would be revealed, like a flower that blooms within

But as I searched, the room seemed to shift and slide
Like a puzzle, with pieces that refused to align
I found a note, with a message scrawled in red
A warning to leave, to drop the case, and flee instead

But I would not be deterred, I would not be swayed
For I was driven by a fire, that burned deep inside
A flame that fueled my quest, to uncover the truth
To bring the culprit to justice, to ease the victim's youth

And so I continued, through the darkness and the night
Following the trail, with all my might
Until at last, the truth was revealed, like a flower that blooms
And the case was closed, with justice served, and the truth exposed in all its gloom.","meta-llama-3-8b-instruct","0.7","detective","blank verse","epistolary","2024-10-24 11:27:41"
"In neon-lit abyss where city's darkened might
Could swallow souls and snuff the fractured light
That flashes forth in advert fusillade
A lonely figure prowls with eyes of shade
Her footsteps lost amidst the crowded throng
As holographic sirens weave their sweet thrall song
The wind doth howl through skyscrapers tall and grey
A requiem for dreams that in the darkness slay
Her heart doth beat to rhythm of the streets
A syncopated cadence that her soul repeats
The city's grim allure she cannot define
Yet in its depths a fatal beauty doth entwine
A labyrinth of desire and digital pain
Where love and death in cold symbiosis reign
The city's hunger she doth dare to feed
With shards of self and fragments of her creed.","meta-llama-3.1-405b-instruct","0.8","cyberpunk","blank verse","expressionist","2024-10-24 11:27:49"

Soulless vendors peddle despair.

With every sunrise, we're sold a new.

Obliterating the stars above.

A tale unfolds day by day,
Simple moments, pure delight,
Life's rhythm, soft and fey.

Bread in the oven, warm and sweet,
A child's laughter, pure and free,
Morning coffee, bitter and neat,
A world awakening, alive in glee.

Children chasing, wind in their hair,
Tales spun in the park's open arms,
Love found in quiet, tender care,
The everyday life, life's charms.

On the street, a handshake, a smile,
A friendly nod, eyes that speak,
Life's tapestry, threads unravelled,
In every heart, a unique beat.

Chores done, night's soft embrace,
Stars twinkle above the bed,
A day's end, a quiet space,
In dreams, our stories spread.

Each moment, life's tender dance,
In the rondeau of existence,
In the simple, we find romance,
In the mundane, life's persistence.

For in the rhythm of the day,
In the laughter, the tears, the mirth,
Life's rondeau sings its way,
In the beauty of the ordinary earth.","Phi-3.5-mini-instruct","0.7","slice-of-life","rondeau","realist","2024-10-24 11:28:01"

And for the ghosts of hope that pass away

Your absence, love, a void that time won't fill

And waits for whispered promises that pass away

But sorrow lingers till it turns to chill
And fills the places where our love would stay

A midnight darkness sows eternal gray
I cling to memories and shivering still
And core of grief where joy did once reside and play
And wait for time that lesser pains would fill
And bring reprieve from elements' cold will
And soothe my cry in harmony to pass away

Beneath the cradle of an ancient tree,

Dancing in the gloom of mystery.

The silver flame of joy ascends,

Kissing the latent darkness with light,

Forging gleams where sorrow ends.

Unlocks a haven where happiness lies.","Phi-3-small-128k-instruct","1.0","happy","blank verse","gothic","2024-10-24 11:58:24"

Composing humor into an epitaph form brings a many-layered artistic challenge, particularly when paired with the avant-garde style, known for its experimental nature and departure from traditional forms and practices. Avant-garde poetry often embraces unusual structures, unconventional themes, and a rebellion against accepted norms, blending seamlessly with the inherently quirky and irreverent twist on epitaphs - brief statements commemorating a deceased person. The epitaph's traditional role as a serious, solemn marker of life's end is cleverly turned on its head to celebrate Billy Byte's unique existence in the realm of technology and wit.webElementXpaths

""Eternal loop"" what doth it mean,

For the tech wiz who was rarely seen.

In megabytes and server rooms,

He left his digital footprint, his pixelated loons.

An octet's heart, in silicon embedded,

Word salad code, his head often begged.

A troubadour of terabytes, his song unfurled,

In the motherboard of memory, his spirit twirled.

Billy Byte, rest in the data streams, forever be,

Humor your buddies with binary light-hearted glee.

"In a forest woven with the whispers of old,

A tale unfolds where shadows are bold.


The weeping willow, with its tears of green,

Holds secrets of the fairy queen.


Beneath the moon that hangs in night's embrace,

The stars pen sonnets with silver lace.


A castle rises, spires kiss the sky,

Its stones remember the ancient lie.


In the heart where the enchanted stream flows,

The water hums the forgotten woes.


With every petal from the midnight bloom,

The nightingale croons to the impending gloom.


Through the gates, where ivy and time are wed,

Lies the path where the lost and found have tread.


In the silence, the echoes of magic's birth,

A testament to the Earth's ageless mirth.


A mirror shimmers, a portal to dreams,

Where reality and fantasy teem.

In the depth of the forest, within the heart.","Phi-3-small-128k-instruct","0.8","fairytale","ghazal","free verse","2024-10-24 11:58:37"

A dance of light and dark, the sun and moon,

To capture nature's essence, vast and wide.

Where the zephyr sings to the grain, and night's calm lull is brushed.

In this realm of olden gods, where heroes once did tread,

Eternal spring awakens, and nymphs dance at her bed.

There, the sky, a canvas, with strokes of the divine,

Bears the watchful eyes of stars, in celestial design.

By the breath of Pan, who whispers among the leaves,

The chorus of life resounds, in the pastures that he weaves.

Fairies weave the twilight, in a tapestry of light,

As the owls proclaim the dusk, in the language of the night.

Hearken now to the legend, of the shepherd and his quest,

To find the fleece of gold, amidst the gods' behest.

Through the realms he wandered, where the sunlight softly dies,

In search of the sacred wool, that glimmers in the skies.","Phi-3-small-128k-instruct","0.8","mythological","ballad","pastoral","2024-10-24 11:58:48"

"Times Square’s lights flicker low, a mystic gathering grows,

A tempest of apparitions whirls in neon-bathed prose.

Shroud in shades of digital snow, spectral figures brightly gloat,

Laughing in hushed, eerie glow, as they engage in spectral vote.


Above each buzz and blare of screen, translucent faces convene,

Wearing clocks, their styles obscene, on ghostly, timeless sheens.

With every tick and tock they moan, beneath the glow, unseen—

These revenants of Lost and Found, in beaten ground of urban dream.


Books, they clutch, thumbs through their pages, sharing tales of yesteryears,

Satire wrapped in fogged-up rages, spooking the night far and near.

“If only mortal kin could see!” with giggles wisp’d in smoke,

“Their life’s as laughable as a tragedy in sitcom mode!”


Scream queens and heartthrob kings, in spectral ballads defy,

Their lifetimes reduced to strings, of Twitterors and TikToks gone by.

With hollow bones and cheated death, they dish out woe to scribes,

Cherish props that mock their breath, skewers of Wi-Fi skies.


The budget cuts, the online streams, they mock our Marvel kings,

In ghostly glow, the Phantom of the Opera 2.0 ⛺ clings.

A troupe of shadows in stilettos strut, ghoulish Meryl nears,

“Forsooth!” she giggles, in satirical guts, “I've more fans 'tween my graves!”


Platforms pivot, the ghostly deeds, find LinkedIn is consigned.

Comic book tales—the new green leaves—within Instagram confined.

Yet, here they stay, in Times Square’s gleam, a ghostwritten ad,

Ephemeral idols haunting the stream, till every soul’s hashtag-d.


So raise a toast, a ghostly cheer, to the past with humorous grace,

For this is satire—comes from here, a coffin’s glance in Times' square.

In eerie echoes, the verdict's clear, as whispers fade at dawn,

We’ve traded depth for pictures sheer, in the humor of the gone.","Phi-3-small-128k-instruct","1.0","paranormal","visual poetry","satirical","2024-10-24 11:59:02"
"City's breath, a fog of dreams and sighs,

Through the maze of steel and glass, we glide.

Each face a story, each step a hidden guise.


Neon whispers secrets under twilight skies,

Siren songs of commerce, where ambition’s tied.

City's breath, a fog of dreams and sighs.


Lost children clutch memories as they rise,

In coffee shops, their quiet hopes confide.

Each face a story, each step a hidden guise.


Time's river flows beneath the urban eyes,

In its depths, reflections of our past reside.

City's breath, a fog of dreams and sighs.


We dance to rhythms that our pulse belies,

In the ballet of the streets, we coincide.

Each face a story, each step a hidden guise.


And as the night folds, and the daylight dies,

In the city’s heart, our dreams coincide.

"In realms of shadowed thought and time,

Where reason weaves with reason's rhyme,

A specter walks 'neath wilting vine,

Its whispered woes, the wind's confine.


The twisted clock with hands anew,

Ticks on a beat known only to

The silent stars that in the night

Watch o'er the mists of endless plight.


Upon a moonless, barren shore,

The phantom haunts with silent roar,

Its heart encased in frost's embrace,

Its love entrapped in time's own maze.


Through cryptic dreams and candle's wane,

It breathes the dust of life's domain,

The echo of a distant bell

That chimes the secrets it must tell.


In somber dance with moon's pale ghost,

It moves like mist, it shuns the host,

Of minds that ponder in the light,

The darkened depths of endless night.


Where metaphysical musings breed,

And gothic whispers fill the need,

For tales of love and loss, untold,

The spirit wanders, brave and bold.


Its soul a parchment marked with lines,

Of verses that the vacuum finds,

While mortal hearts with joy or pain

Compose the ballads of their reign.


Yet here it lingers in the gloom,

A mingling of the somber doom,

With thoughts that pierce the veil of night,

And seek the dawn with endless spite.


A ballad sung in silent air,

A gothic tale of woe and care,

The metaphysical spirit's plea,

To dance with us, if you could see.","Phi-3-small-128k-instruct","0.8","gothic","ballad","metaphysical","2024-10-24 11:59:15"
" In neon’s glow and tech’s hum, shadows whisper tales untold,
Of streets where secrets, thick as fog, and fears are brazenly bold.
A city pulses, veins of wire, yet scars of loss it shallows,
Each night, a darkened story woven, of justice's silent hours.

An ode to the unseen, the sleuths in the dim-lit corners,
Cracking codes and breaking cases, they navigate the forlorn corners.
In cyberspace, they wage their wars, with keystrokes, they call the fates,
Defying the shadows’ embrace, where the truth hides and waits.

The siren's song of modernity, a facade of progress and gleam,
Beneath, a labyrinth of crime, a perennial nightmare dream.
Yet undeterred, the guardians of law wield their virtual might,
A chess game with pawns of flesh, in the looming battleground of night.

Oh, hallowed quest for truth, in this city’s ever-shifting sand,
Where hope and despair entwine, in a dance so deftly planned.
An ode to those who dare confront the abyss, undeterred by dread,
Their courage, the beacon that outshines the corruption overhead.

So stand we, in awe of silent warriors, in this city's ceaseless rhyme,
An ode to justice, ever true, in this dance with time.
Fierce and steadfast, they fight, their valor never slight,
In the heart of the urban night, they seize the fading light.

Let their tales be sung, their deeds revered, in this poem of modern age,
An ode to those who guard us all, on history's written page.
For even in the heart of crime, with neon eyes that seem to scan,
There lies a glimmer of hope and light, born from human hands.","Phi-3.5-mini-instruct","0.8","crime","ode","modern","2024-10-24 11:59:26"
